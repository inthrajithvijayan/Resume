    <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out how to enable IP source routing protection through GPO in Windows Server 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following instructions I've read online I haven't found this option through the path:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Configuration -&amp;gt; Windows Settings -&amp;gt; Security Settings -&amp;gt; Local Policies -&amp;gt; Security Options -&amp;gt; "MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)" to "Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any links on how exactly to see and enable this option?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at a new company and i asked the manager recently when the last time they changed their passwords and she couldn't remember the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;At the last company i used to work for i had to change them once a month which is fine because i have a good memory and company was an IT company so everyone was tech savvy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked by boss how often he would like me to reset the passwords&amp;nbsp; for all users and he says every 6 months with the exception that him and a few other managers never have to change theirs. Which i don't think is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be my plan of attack so users dont write down their passwords and are well notified so i dont get phone calls throughout the night.&amp;nbsp; Do you think its fair that the managers told me NOT to reset theirs? How often does your company reset passwords?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;team, I have disabled the vaultsvc which is for credential manager, yet if I run this rundll32.exe keymgr.dll, KRShowKeyMgr I still see passwords being stored. How do I prevent this from happening? The environment is Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using WIP rules to protect apps on our enrolled Windows 10 Azure AD joined laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Intune App Protection - Protected apps - "Office-365-ProPlus-1708-Allowed.xml" is on allow list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Office apps are running under Enterprise context and works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When downloading a file via IE/Edge we can only save the file as "Personal" on OneDrive. If drive is saved in Work context OneDrive won't sync the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A policy set by your IT Administrator prevents you from syncing this work file to Onedrive folder"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneDrive.exe is indeed running in enterprise context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain this behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a couple users in a 300+ user environment that are having issues printing from word or outlook or even notepad. When they go to print, upon hitting print the program freezes. When you open the devices and printer window, it takes for ever to load and then it hangs at the end. I've found that when trying to restart the print spooler it comes up with an error 1053: the service did not respond. I've tried enabling the Bluetooth support service and set it to run automatically but that doesn't work. I also found out that you have to try and load the printers and devices, open up the services and attempt to restart the print spooler, wait for it to timeout, refresh the printer and devices window, start the print spooler and then do it all again one more time for it to fix the issue. I'm looking for a permanent fix to this issue. I've tried imagining the computer even reinstalling it from scratch but the error keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Alrighty everyone, here's the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a couple of Windows 10 pro computers, running a second copy of Windows 10 pro within a Hyper-V virtual machine that's connected to a different domain.&amp;nbsp; Both the host machine, and the VM have Office 2016 installed via an Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the host machine, when we right-click on an .xlsx file and select 'print', the Excel file prints successfully to the default printer and if you look in the process list, the Excel.exe process that opens during the print, closes successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the VM, if you attempt the same thing, the excel.exe process does not get closed.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Excel will leave an Excel.exe process open for each file that you right-click &amp;gt; print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this on 2 different workstations set up this way, and both behaved the same way.&amp;nbsp; Both Windows and MS Office have been fully updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an issue as one of our users prints a lot of excel docs and eventually runs out of memory on the VM due to all of the leftover Excel.exe processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find that if you open Excel first and just minimize it, and then right-click &amp;gt; print the .xlsx files you need to print, the Excel.exe processes close properly when they are done being printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround works for now, however it would be great if anyone knows of a way to fix this permanently. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a recovery partition that I'm testing out on an HP laptop - I used EasyBCD to create a WinPE boot entry and added it to the boot menu.&amp;nbsp; If I leave the settings default, every time the laptop restarts the Windows Boot Manager will appear and wait 30 seconds (or however long I set it) for me to pick to boot to Windows 10, or to the WinPE recovery partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to do is set the boot menu to not appear by default, and simply be able to call it up if/when it's needed.&amp;nbsp; I have not been able to find any keyboard shortcuts that will bring up the boot menu (only the Advanced Startup).&amp;nbsp; Is there a way to manually load the Windows Boot Manager, but have it not load up by default each time the computer reboots?&amp;nbsp; Thanks in advance for the help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so I have various version of windows 10, a few 1511, couple 1603, most either 1703 or 1709.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can someone point me on the best way to setup updating via WSUS, and WSUS only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do NOT want my desktops getting updates from each other, or from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to approve the updates on my WSUS server, and then the PCs download the updates from the WSUS server ..only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a GPO for branchcache already configured, from when I had issues last year with windows updates killing one of my remote sites, but I have a feeling I do not have everything configured the best way, that I may be missing something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are having issues adding a second Connection Broker to our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 - RDS-Connection Broker - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - RDS- Session Hosts - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Machine we want to add RDS-CB to (RDS-MGR) and is running the SQL Express 2016 for the HA and the OS is Windows 2012 R2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started because we were wanting to move the RDS-CB off of the server it is currently on.&amp;nbsp; (Current server is the DC).&amp;nbsp; So through some investigating we found that the best way to do this is to set up the HA, add the new server, then remove the existing server.&amp;nbsp; We have followed the information at this link: https://thewolfblog.com/2014/02/02/configuring-ha-for-the-remote-desktop-connection-broker/ to a "T" (as well as a few others that were pretty well the same with slight differences).&amp;nbsp; We have been successful in getting the HA configured and the database moved to the SQL Express 2016.&amp;nbsp; We are having issues getting the new server added as a broker now.&amp;nbsp; We are getting an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The database specified in the connection string Driver=SQL Server Native Client 11.0;SERVER=RDS-MGR\RDSQL;Trusted_Connection=Yes;APP=Remote Desktop Services Connection Broker;DATABASE=RDSQL is not available from the RD Connection Broker server RDS-MGR.domain.&amp;nbsp; Ensure that the database server is available on the network, the SQL Server Native Client is installed on all RD Connection Broker servers, and the computer accounts of the RD Connection Broker servers are members of the RDS Management Servers group on the database server."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have created a new separate test server to see if it can be configured as an RDS CB server, and it gets the same error when trying to add it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original CB server and the two new servers all have the SQL client on them and all pass the connection test when going through the ODBC configuration.&amp;nbsp; Firewall has been turned off on all involved servers to ensure that it is not interfering.&amp;nbsp; The test server and new server have been rebooted several times (cannot reboot the original server right now).&amp;nbsp; We have checked that the servers are added to the AD security group that is used in the SQL authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot figure out why this is not connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one...we use a system to manage passwords so admins don't ever actually have their passwords for their privileged accounts, and it grants access to their resources via RDP sessions to a terminal server which launches an application on login without launching the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, this works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently enough, though (usually get at least a couple reports per day), after logging in to the server, the userinit.exe program will get an "Access is denied" error trying to launch the initial program.&amp;nbsp; The login itself is successful as I can open Task Manager and use it to launch Windows Explorer; I can even manually launch the program itself without problems at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses an unprivileged service account, the same one for every application and every person, and passes the password information into the call to the initial program (this has the unfortunate side effect of revealing their current password in the error box that comes up, though it resets every 24 hours).&amp;nbsp; I do see security log audit failures for the service account around the times it acts up.&amp;nbsp; The entries look like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to implement sleep in my domain to save on power costs for my school. Users each have their home folder mapped (N: drive) by GPO's profile tab and a number of other drives mapped by client side preferences, desktop and favourites redirected to folders under N: drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently if I log in and then manually sleep the computer with mapped home drive open in explorer when I wake up, explorer has gone back to the "my computer" view and all mapped drives have red crosses on them. The desktop has also lost connection to the redirected folder. Simply opening a mapped drive will reconnect it, however we have applications that require the mapped drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should mapped drives automatically reconnected when windows 7 resumes from sleep? Or is sleep something that just can not be used with drive maps and redirected documents? Any pointers on potential config issues greatly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Evening,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a RDS server with approx&amp;nbsp; 13-15 users on there at any one time. The server is hightly spec'd ( its a VM) with 16 cores and 76GB of Ram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRM package we are using seems to struggle between&amp;nbsp; when clicking between wwindows ( runs on flat database not SQL ) . They are saying it could be antivirus ( Sophos ) which i have set exclusions to this folder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any ideas? Antivirus issue? CRM Software ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had some recent IT changes which resulted into a few of our members joining the Dev team. They still need access to manager VMs but we do not need them having access to the entire fleet of VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way they can still user Hyper-V management to only see a limited number of VMs chosen by us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Does "honey I told you so" sound familiar.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day at work and get home to "it keeps ASKING me to update windows".&amp;nbsp; Like an idiot I say "you might as well it will force you to eventually".&amp;nbsp; (Win Pro not enterprise so sooner or later it would)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please cue "crap hitting fan"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Explorer re-starts constantly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Then after a few reboots I get into recovery mode (which mind you is a PITA wth happened to whacking on F8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. SFC said (can't find anything and can't finish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. System repair couldn't finish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Tech (me :( ) reboots waits for application error dialog box to come up mbaiapi.dll caused an error in windows explorer and if I leave the dialog box up explorer doesn't bounce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Disable stuff using msconfig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Reboot... and now no login prompt.&amp;nbsp; (well I thought I had checked "hide MS services" but maybe not)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I have a fun weekend task.&amp;nbsp; Any suggestions.&amp;nbsp; I'll be bringing home&amp;nbsp; a stick with 10 on it so I can boot off it but I really will find doing a reset to suck.&amp;nbsp; (I'm going to copy data off it so at least I have t he option.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was looking for some advice on the best way to deploy a semi-complicated application to our Enterpise environment. Our company just recently upgraded our SCCM to the latest version from SCCM 2007. We are currently in the process of rolling out/testing Windows 10 to about 400 machines. We've slowly been packaging our most used apps, and I put my hand up to try packing probably the most difficult one (at least in my eyes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Document Management System is a horrible program called Autonomy iManege FileSite (or Worksite). We currently have version 8.5 installed on all machines throughout the company as it's part of the MOE. Version 8.5 is made up of three separate installations. FileSite 8.5 itself, FileSite 8.5 Email Management for Outlook, and FileSite 8.5 Web Components. These show up as separate installs in Programs and Features, and we do have the .MSI files for these, so they should be easy to uninstall/supersede.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ned this to replace many one line emails to everyone i the office with minor notices.&amp;nbsp; Something that would simply pop up an Alert window with a one line message as it does when new email comes in would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have see this question asked and answered on SpiceWorks in several places but most of the info is so old that the products list are no longer made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anything current?&amp;nbsp; Or is Yammer a good alternative as we al have it but no one uses it and i need something so simple Anyone could figure out out with Zero effort.&amp;nbsp; Like sending an email.&amp;nbsp; While I am not looking for an Inter-office Chat app, the ability to reply to an alert&amp;nbsp; would be nice.&amp;nbsp; As would the ability to keep the alert on screen until closed&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Gents&lt;br /&gt;My people report that local files on the server are always opened SECURE in word 2010.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how Office detects that. Where are the flags and can I remove them.&lt;br /&gt;I already run a GPO which defines the server root folder\* as a SECURE place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resaving the DOC seems also not to help but I have to check if saving to DocX helps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are using Office365 with local Outlook 2016 clients. Our spam filtering is Proofpoint. I know Proofpoint can stop an email if it contains private information (credit card #, SSN, bank account, etc). I would like to know if there is anything that can be integrated into Outlook that will trigger a pop-up window to confirm that the user understands the dangers of sending this information?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out how to enable IP source routing protection through GPO in Windows Server 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following instructions I've read online I haven't found this option through the path:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Configuration -&amp;gt; Windows Settings -&amp;gt; Security Settings -&amp;gt; Local Policies -&amp;gt; Security Options -&amp;gt; "MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)" to "Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled".&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at a new company and i asked the manager recently when the last time they changed their passwords and she couldn't remember the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;At the last company i used to work for i had to change them once a month which is fine because i have a good memory and company was an IT company so everyone was tech savvy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked by boss how often he would like me to reset the passwords&amp;nbsp; for all users and he says every 6 months with the exception that him and a few other managers never have to change theirs. Which i don't think is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be my plan of attack so users dont write down their passwords and are well notified so i dont get phone calls throughout the night.&amp;nbsp; Do you think its fair that the managers told me NOT to reset theirs? How often does your company reset passwords?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using WIP rules to protect apps on our enrolled Windows 10 Azure AD joined laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Intune App Protection - Protected apps - "Office-365-ProPlus-1708-Allowed.xml" is on allow list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Office apps are running under Enterprise context and works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When downloading a file via IE/Edge we can only save the file as "Personal" on OneDrive. If drive is saved in Work context OneDrive won't sync the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A policy set by your IT Administrator prevents you from syncing this work file to Onedrive folder"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneDrive.exe is indeed running in enterprise context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain this behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a couple users in a 300+ user environment that are having issues printing from word or outlook or even notepad. When they go to print, upon hitting print the program freezes. When you open the devices and printer window, it takes for ever to load and then it hangs at the end. I've found that when trying to restart the print spooler it comes up with an error 1053: the service did not respond. I've tried enabling the Bluetooth support service and set it to run automatically but that doesn't work. I also found out that you have to try and load the printers and devices, open up the services and attempt to restart the print spooler, wait for it to timeout, refresh the printer and devices window, start the print spooler and then do it all again one more time for it to fix the issue. I'm looking for a permanent fix to this issue. I've tried imagining the computer even reinstalling it from scratch but the error keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Alrighty everyone, here's the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a couple of Windows 10 pro computers, running a second copy of Windows 10 pro within a Hyper-V virtual machine that's connected to a different domain.&amp;nbsp; Both the host machine, and the VM have Office 2016 installed via an Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the host machine, when we right-click on an .xlsx file and select 'print', the Excel file prints successfully to the default printer and if you look in the process list, the Excel.exe process that opens during the print, closes successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the VM, if you attempt the same thing, the excel.exe process does not get closed.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Excel will leave an Excel.exe process open for each file that you right-click &amp;gt; print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this on 2 different workstations set up this way, and both behaved the same way.&amp;nbsp; Both Windows and MS Office have been fully updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an issue as one of our users prints a lot of excel docs and eventually runs out of memory on the VM due to all of the leftover Excel.exe processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find that if you open Excel first and just minimize it, and then right-click &amp;gt; print the .xlsx files you need to print, the Excel.exe processes close properly when they are done being printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround works for now, however it would be great if anyone knows of a way to fix this permanently. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a recovery partition that I'm testing out on an HP laptop - I used EasyBCD to create a WinPE boot entry and added it to the boot menu.&amp;nbsp; If I leave the settings default, every time the laptop restarts the Windows Boot Manager will appear and wait 30 seconds (or however long I set it) for me to pick to boot to Windows 10, or to the WinPE recovery partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to do is set the boot menu to not appear by default, and simply be able to call it up if/when it's needed.&amp;nbsp; I have not been able to find any keyboard shortcuts that will bring up the boot menu (only the Advanced Startup).&amp;nbsp; Is there a way to manually load the Windows Boot Manager, but have it not load up by default each time the computer reboots?&amp;nbsp; Thanks in advance for the help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so I have various version of windows 10, a few 1511, couple 1603, most either 1703 or 1709.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can someone point me on the best way to setup updating via WSUS, and WSUS only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do NOT want my desktops getting updates from each other, or from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to approve the updates on my WSUS server, and then the PCs download the updates from the WSUS server ..only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a GPO for branchcache already configured, from when I had issues last year with windows updates killing one of my remote sites, but I have a feeling I do not have everything configured the best way, that I may be missing something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are having issues adding a second Connection Broker to our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 - RDS-Connection Broker - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - RDS- Session Hosts - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Machine we want to add RDS-CB to (RDS-MGR) and is running the SQL Express 2016 for the HA and the OS is Windows 2012 R2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started because we were wanting to move the RDS-CB off of the server it is currently on.&amp;nbsp; (Current server is the DC).&amp;nbsp; So through some investigating we found that the best way to do this is to set up the HA, add the new server, then remove the existing server.&amp;nbsp; We have followed the information at this link: https://thewolfblog.com/2014/02/02/configuring-ha-for-the-remote-desktop-connection-broker/ to a "T" (as well as a few others that were pretty well the same with slight differences).&amp;nbsp; We have been successful in getting the HA configured and the database moved to the SQL Express 2016.&amp;nbsp; We are having issues getting the new server added as a broker now.&amp;nbsp; We are getting an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The database specified in the connection string Driver=SQL Server Native Client 11.0;SERVER=RDS-MGR\RDSQL;Trusted_Connection=Yes;APP=Remote Desktop Services Connection Broker;DATABASE=RDSQL is not available from the RD Connection Broker server RDS-MGR.domain.&amp;nbsp; Ensure that the database server is available on the network, the SQL Server Native Client is installed on all RD Connection Broker servers, and the computer accounts of the RD Connection Broker servers are members of the RDS Management Servers group on the database server."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have created a new separate test server to see if it can be configured as an RDS CB server, and it gets the same error when trying to add it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original CB server and the two new servers all have the SQL client on them and all pass the connection test when going through the ODBC configuration.&amp;nbsp; Firewall has been turned off on all involved servers to ensure that it is not interfering.&amp;nbsp; The test server and new server have been rebooted several times (cannot reboot the original server right now).&amp;nbsp; We have checked that the servers are added to the AD security group that is used in the SQL authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot figure out why this is not connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one...we use a system to manage passwords so admins don't ever actually have their passwords for their privileged accounts, and it grants access to their resources via RDP sessions to a terminal server which launches an application on login without launching the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, this works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently enough, though (usually get at least a couple reports per day), after logging in to the server, the userinit.exe program will get an "Access is denied" error trying to launch the initial program.&amp;nbsp; The login itself is successful as I can open Task Manager and use it to launch Windows Explorer; I can even manually launch the program itself without problems at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses an unprivileged service account, the same one for every application and every person, and passes the password information into the call to the initial program (this has the unfortunate side effect of revealing their current password in the error box that comes up, though it resets every 24 hours).&amp;nbsp; I do see security log audit failures for the service account around the times it acts up.&amp;nbsp; The entries look like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to implement sleep in my domain to save on power costs for my school. Users each have their home folder mapped (N: drive) by GPO's profile tab and a number of other drives mapped by client side preferences, desktop and favourites redirected to folders under N: drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently if I log in and then manually sleep the computer with mapped home drive open in explorer when I wake up, explorer has gone back to the "my computer" view and all mapped drives have red crosses on them. The desktop has also lost connection to the redirected folder. Simply opening a mapped drive will reconnect it, however we have applications that require the mapped drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should mapped drives automatically reconnected when windows 7 resumes from sleep? Or is sleep something that just can not be used with drive maps and redirected documents? Any pointers on potential config issues greatly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Evening,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a RDS server with approx&amp;nbsp; 13-15 users on there at any one time. The server is hightly spec'd ( its a VM) with 16 cores and 76GB of Ram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRM package we are using seems to struggle between&amp;nbsp; when clicking between wwindows ( runs on flat database not SQL ) . They are saying it could be antivirus ( Sophos ) which i have set exclusions to this folder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any ideas? Antivirus issue? CRM Software ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Happened yesterday right after a big Windows update overnight.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, my GPO doesn't have any such policy, I've never set it.&amp;nbsp; I am the admin of this network, and in a few cases I've even expressly permitted the use of USB drives.&amp;nbsp; Brand new drive, straight out of the package.&amp;nbsp; Works on the laptop three feet away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had some recent IT changes which resulted into a few of our members joining the Dev team. They still need access to manager VMs but we do not need them having access to the entire fleet of VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way they can still user Hyper-V management to only see a limited number of VMs chosen by us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Does "honey I told you so" sound familiar.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day at work and get home to "it keeps ASKING me to update windows".&amp;nbsp; Like an idiot I say "you might as well it will force you to eventually".&amp;nbsp; (Win Pro not enterprise so sooner or later it would)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please cue "crap hitting fan"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Explorer re-starts constantly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Then after a few reboots I get into recovery mode (which mind you is a PITA wth happened to whacking on F8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. SFC said (can't find anything and can't finish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. System repair couldn't finish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Tech (me :( ) reboots waits for application error dialog box to come up mbaiapi.dll caused an error in windows explorer and if I leave the dialog box up explorer doesn't bounce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Disable stuff using msconfig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Reboot... and now no login prompt.&amp;nbsp; (well I thought I had checked "hide MS services" but maybe not)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I have a fun weekend task.&amp;nbsp; Any suggestions.&amp;nbsp; I'll be bringing home&amp;nbsp; a stick with 10 on it so I can boot off it but I really will find doing a reset to suck.&amp;nbsp; (I'm going to copy data off it so at least I have t he option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't had this at work going from 1703 to 1709 so I wonder what the heck blew up.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day and really hadn't wanted to do it at home too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was looking for some advice on the best way to deploy a semi-complicated application to our Enterpise environment. Our company just recently upgraded our SCCM to the latest version from SCCM 2007. We are currently in the process of rolling out/testing Windows 10 to about 400 machines. We've slowly been packaging our most used apps, and I put my hand up to try packing probably the most difficult one (at least in my eyes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Document Management System is a horrible program called Autonomy iManege FileSite (or Worksite). We currently have version 8.5 installed on all machines throughout the company as it's part of the MOE. Version 8.5 is made up of three separate installations. FileSite 8.5 itself, FileSite 8.5 Email Management for Outlook, and FileSite 8.5 Web Components. These show up as separate installs in Programs and Features, and we do have the .MSI files for these, so they should be easy to uninstall/supersede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found on Spiceworks: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2162634-deploying-complicated-application-via-sccm-in-enterprise-environment?utm_source=copy_paste&amp;amp;utm_campaign=growth&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ned this to replace many one line emails to everyone i the office with minor notices.&amp;nbsp; Something that would simply pop up an Alert window with a one line message as it does when new email comes in would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have see this question asked and answered on SpiceWorks in several places but most of the info is so old that the products list are no longer made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anything current?&amp;nbsp; Or is Yammer a good alternative as we al have it but no one uses it and i need something so simple Anyone could figure out out with Zero effort.&amp;nbsp; Like sending an email.&amp;nbsp; While I am not looking for an Inter-office Chat app, the ability to reply to an alert&amp;nbsp; would be nice.&amp;nbsp; As would the ability to keep the alert on screen until closed&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Gents&lt;br /&gt;My people report that local files on the server are always opened SECURE in word 2010.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how Office detects that. Where are the flags and can I remove them.&lt;br /&gt;I already run a GPO which defines the server root folder\* as a SECURE place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resaving the DOC seems also not to help but I have to check if saving to DocX helps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out how to enable IP source routing protection through GPO in Windows Server 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following instructions I've read online I haven't found this option through the path:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Configuration -&amp;gt; Windows Settings -&amp;gt; Security Settings -&amp;gt; Local Policies -&amp;gt; Security Options -&amp;gt; "MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)" to "Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any links on how exactly to see and enable this option?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This could come down to a question of how valuable your time is, vs. cost of a new unit that could take the place of the existing one. It might just be time to move on up ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally thinking if you had an SSD kicking around (eg a smaller one pulled out of another unit), but in that laptop, you'd have to get a converter board/adapter and mount the SSD in the optical drive bay... and given the age of the hardware it'd sure be a pursuit of diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;</message>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at a new company and i asked the manager recently when the last time they changed their passwords and she couldn't remember the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;At the last company i used to work for i had to change them once a month which is fine because i have a good memory and company was an IT company so everyone was tech savvy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked by boss how often he would like me to reset the passwords&amp;nbsp; for all users and he says every 6 months with the exception that him and a few other managers never have to change theirs. Which i don't think is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be my plan of attack so users dont write down their passwords and are well notified so i dont get phone calls throughout the night.&amp;nbsp; Do you think its fair that the managers told me NOT to reset theirs? How often does your company reset passwords?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using WIP rules to protect apps on our enrolled Windows 10 Azure AD joined laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Intune App Protection - Protected apps - "Office-365-ProPlus-1708-Allowed.xml" is on allow list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Office apps are running under Enterprise context and works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When downloading a file via IE/Edge we can only save the file as "Personal" on OneDrive. If drive is saved in Work context OneDrive won't sync the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A policy set by your IT Administrator prevents you from syncing this work file to Onedrive folder"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneDrive.exe is indeed running in enterprise context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain this behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a couple users in a 300+ user environment that are having issues printing from word or outlook or even notepad. When they go to print, upon hitting print the program freezes. When you open the devices and printer window, it takes for ever to load and then it hangs at the end. I've found that when trying to restart the print spooler it comes up with an error 1053: the service did not respond. I've tried enabling the Bluetooth support service and set it to run automatically but that doesn't work. I also found out that you have to try and load the printers and devices, open up the services and attempt to restart the print spooler, wait for it to timeout, refresh the printer and devices window, start the print spooler and then do it all again one more time for it to fix the issue. I'm looking for a permanent fix to this issue. I've tried imagining the computer even reinstalling it from scratch but the error keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Alrighty everyone, here's the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a couple of Windows 10 pro computers, running a second copy of Windows 10 pro within a Hyper-V virtual machine that's connected to a different domain.&amp;nbsp; Both the host machine, and the VM have Office 2016 installed via an Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the host machine, when we right-click on an .xlsx file and select 'print', the Excel file prints successfully to the default printer and if you look in the process list, the Excel.exe process that opens during the print, closes successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the VM, if you attempt the same thing, the excel.exe process does not get closed.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Excel will leave an Excel.exe process open for each file that you right-click &amp;gt; print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this on 2 different workstations set up this way, and both behaved the same way.&amp;nbsp; Both Windows and MS Office have been fully updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an issue as one of our users prints a lot of excel docs and eventually runs out of memory on the VM due to all of the leftover Excel.exe processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find that if you open Excel first and just minimize it, and then right-click &amp;gt; print the .xlsx files you need to print, the Excel.exe processes close properly when they are done being printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround works for now, however it would be great if anyone knows of a way to fix this permanently. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a recovery partition that I'm testing out on an HP laptop - I used EasyBCD to create a WinPE boot entry and added it to the boot menu.&amp;nbsp; If I leave the settings default, every time the laptop restarts the Windows Boot Manager will appear and wait 30 seconds (or however long I set it) for me to pick to boot to Windows 10, or to the WinPE recovery partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to do is set the boot menu to not appear by default, and simply be able to call it up if/when it's needed.&amp;nbsp; I have not been able to find any keyboard shortcuts that will bring up the boot menu (only the Advanced Startup).&amp;nbsp; Is there a way to manually load the Windows Boot Manager, but have it not load up by default each time the computer reboots?&amp;nbsp; Thanks in advance for the help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so I have various version of windows 10, a few 1511, couple 1603, most either 1703 or 1709.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can someone point me on the best way to setup updating via WSUS, and WSUS only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do NOT want my desktops getting updates from each other, or from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to approve the updates on my WSUS server, and then the PCs download the updates from the WSUS server ..only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a GPO for branchcache already configured, from when I had issues last year with windows updates killing one of my remote sites, but I have a feeling I do not have everything configured the best way, that I may be missing something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are having issues adding a second Connection Broker to our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 - RDS-Connection Broker - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - RDS- Session Hosts - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Machine we want to add RDS-CB to (RDS-MGR) and is running the SQL Express 2016 for the HA and the OS is Windows 2012 R2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started because we were wanting to move the RDS-CB off of the server it is currently on.&amp;nbsp; (Current server is the DC).&amp;nbsp; So through some investigating we found that the best way to do this is to set up the HA, add the new server, then remove the existing server.&amp;nbsp; We have followed the information at this link: https://thewolfblog.com/2014/02/02/configuring-ha-for-the-remote-desktop-connection-broker/ to a "T" (as well as a few others that were pretty well the same with slight differences).&amp;nbsp; We have been successful in getting the HA configured and the database moved to the SQL Express 2016.&amp;nbsp; We are having issues getting the new server added as a broker now.&amp;nbsp; We are getting an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The database specified in the connection string Driver=SQL Server Native Client 11.0;SERVER=RDS-MGR\RDSQL;Trusted_Connection=Yes;APP=Remote Desktop Services Connection Broker;DATABASE=RDSQL is not available from the RD Connection Broker server RDS-MGR.domain.&amp;nbsp; Ensure that the database server is available on the network, the SQL Server Native Client is installed on all RD Connection Broker servers, and the computer accounts of the RD Connection Broker servers are members of the RDS Management Servers group on the database server."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have created a new separate test server to see if it can be configured as an RDS CB server, and it gets the same error when trying to add it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original CB server and the two new servers all have the SQL client on them and all pass the connection test when going through the ODBC configuration.&amp;nbsp; Firewall has been turned off on all involved servers to ensure that it is not interfering.&amp;nbsp; The test server and new server have been rebooted several times (cannot reboot the original server right now).&amp;nbsp; We have checked that the servers are added to the AD security group that is used in the SQL authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot figure out why this is not connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one...we use a system to manage passwords so admins don't ever actually have their passwords for their privileged accounts, and it grants access to their resources via RDP sessions to a terminal server which launches an application on login without launching the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, this works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently enough, though (usually get at least a couple reports per day), after logging in to the server, the userinit.exe program will get an "Access is denied" error trying to launch the initial program.&amp;nbsp; The login itself is successful as I can open Task Manager and use it to launch Windows Explorer; I can even manually launch the program itself without problems at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses an unprivileged service account, the same one for every application and every person, and passes the password information into the call to the initial program (this has the unfortunate side effect of revealing their current password in the error box that comes up, though it resets every 24 hours).&amp;nbsp; I do see security log audit failures for the service account around the times it acts up.&amp;nbsp; The entries look like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to implement sleep in my domain to save on power costs for my school. Users each have their home folder mapped (N: drive) by GPO's profile tab and a number of other drives mapped by client side preferences, desktop and favourites redirected to folders under N: drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently if I log in and then manually sleep the computer with mapped home drive open in explorer when I wake up, explorer has gone back to the "my computer" view and all mapped drives have red crosses on them. The desktop has also lost connection to the redirected folder. Simply opening a mapped drive will reconnect it, however we have applications that require the mapped drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should mapped drives automatically reconnected when windows 7 resumes from sleep? Or is sleep something that just can not be used with drive maps and redirected documents? Any pointers on potential config issues greatly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Evening,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a RDS server with approx&amp;nbsp; 13-15 users on there at any one time. The server is hightly spec'd ( its a VM) with 16 cores and 76GB of Ram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRM package we are using seems to struggle between&amp;nbsp; when clicking between wwindows ( runs on flat database not SQL ) . They are saying it could be antivirus ( Sophos ) which i have set exclusions to this folder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have had some recent IT changes which resulted into a few of our members joining the Dev team. They still need access to manager VMs but we do not need them having access to the entire fleet of VMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please cue "crap hitting fan"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Explorer re-starts constantly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Then after a few reboots I get into recovery mode (which mind you is a PITA wth happened to whacking on F8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 Tech (me :( ) reboots waits for application error dialog box to come up mbaiapi.dll caused an error in windows explorer and if I leave the dialog box up explorer doesn't bounce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Disable stuff using msconfig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Reboot... and now no login prompt.&amp;nbsp; (well I thought I had checked "hide MS services" but maybe not)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I have a fun weekend task.&amp;nbsp; Any suggestions.&amp;nbsp; I'll be bringing home&amp;nbsp; a stick with 10 on it so I can boot off it but I really will find doing a reset to suck.&amp;nbsp; (I'm going to copy data off it so at least I have t he option.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was looking for some advice on the best way to deploy a semi-complicated application to our Enterpise environment. Our company just recently upgraded our SCCM to the latest version from SCCM 2007. We are currently in the process of rolling out/testing Windows 10 to about 400 machines. We've slowly been packaging our most used apps, and I put my hand up to try packing probably the most difficult one (at least in my eyes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Document Management System is a horrible program called Autonomy iManege FileSite (or Worksite). We currently have version 8.5 installed on all machines throughout the company as it's part of the MOE. Version 8.5 is made up of three separate installations. FileSite 8.5 itself, FileSite 8.5 Email Management for Outlook, and FileSite 8.5 Web Components. These show up as separate installs in Programs and Features, and we do have the .MSI files for these, so they should be easy to uninstall/supersede.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ned this to replace many one line emails to everyone i the office with minor notices.&amp;nbsp; Something that would simply pop up an Alert window with a one line message as it does when new email comes in would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have see this question asked and answered on SpiceWorks in several places but most of the info is so old that the products list are no longer made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anything current?&amp;nbsp; Or is Yammer a good alternative as we al have it but no one uses it and i need something so simple Anyone could figure out out with Zero effort.&amp;nbsp; Like sending an email.&amp;nbsp; While I am not looking for an Inter-office Chat app, the ability to reply to an alert&amp;nbsp; would be nice.&amp;nbsp; As would the ability to keep the alert on screen until closed&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Gents&lt;br /&gt;My people report that local files on the server are always opened SECURE in word 2010.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how Office detects that. Where are the flags and can I remove them.&lt;br /&gt;I already run a GPO which defines the server root folder\* as a SECURE place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out how to enable IP source routing protection through GPO in Windows Server 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following instructions I've read online I haven't found this option through the path:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Configuration -&amp;gt; Windows Settings -&amp;gt; Security Settings -&amp;gt; Local Policies -&amp;gt; Security Options -&amp;gt; "MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)" to "Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled".&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at a new company and i asked the manager recently when the last time they changed their passwords and she couldn't remember the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;At the last company i used to work for i had to change them once a month which is fine because i have a good memory and company was an IT company so everyone was tech savvy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked by boss how often he would like me to reset the passwords&amp;nbsp; for all users and he says every 6 months with the exception that him and a few other managers never have to change theirs. Which i don't think is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be my plan of attack so users dont write down their passwords and are well notified so i dont get phone calls throughout the night.&amp;nbsp; Do you think its fair that the managers told me NOT to reset theirs? How often does your company reset passwords?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using WIP rules to protect apps on our enrolled Windows 10 Azure AD joined laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Intune App Protection - Protected apps - "Office-365-ProPlus-1708-Allowed.xml" is on allow list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Office apps are running under Enterprise context and works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When downloading a file via IE/Edge we can only save the file as "Personal" on OneDrive. If drive is saved in Work context OneDrive won't sync the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A policy set by your IT Administrator prevents you from syncing this work file to Onedrive folder"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneDrive.exe is indeed running in enterprise context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain this behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a couple users in a 300+ user environment that are having issues printing from word or outlook or even notepad. When they go to print, upon hitting print the program freezes. When you open the devices and printer window, it takes for ever to load and then it hangs at the end. I've found that when trying to restart the print spooler it comes up with an error 1053: the service did not respond. I've tried enabling the Bluetooth support service and set it to run automatically but that doesn't work. I also found out that you have to try and load the printers and devices, open up the services and attempt to restart the print spooler, wait for it to timeout, refresh the printer and devices window, start the print spooler and then do it all again one more time for it to fix the issue. I'm looking for a permanent fix to this issue. I've tried imagining the computer even reinstalling it from scratch but the error keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Alrighty everyone, here's the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a couple of Windows 10 pro computers, running a second copy of Windows 10 pro within a Hyper-V virtual machine that's connected to a different domain.&amp;nbsp; Both the host machine, and the VM have Office 2016 installed via an Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the host machine, when we right-click on an .xlsx file and select 'print', the Excel file prints successfully to the default printer and if you look in the process list, the Excel.exe process that opens during the print, closes successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the VM, if you attempt the same thing, the excel.exe process does not get closed.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Excel will leave an Excel.exe process open for each file that you right-click &amp;gt; print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this on 2 different workstations set up this way, and both behaved the same way.&amp;nbsp; Both Windows and MS Office have been fully updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an issue as one of our users prints a lot of excel docs and eventually runs out of memory on the VM due to all of the leftover Excel.exe processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find that if you open Excel first and just minimize it, and then right-click &amp;gt; print the .xlsx files you need to print, the Excel.exe processes close properly when they are done being printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround works for now, however it would be great if anyone knows of a way to fix this permanently. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a recovery partition that I'm testing out on an HP laptop - I used EasyBCD to create a WinPE boot entry and added it to the boot menu.&amp;nbsp; If I leave the settings default, every time the laptop restarts the Windows Boot Manager will appear and wait 30 seconds (or however long I set it) for me to pick to boot to Windows 10, or to the WinPE recovery partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to do is set the boot menu to not appear by default, and simply be able to call it up if/when it's needed.&amp;nbsp; I have not been able to find any keyboard shortcuts that will bring up the boot menu (only the Advanced Startup).&amp;nbsp; Is there a way to manually load the Windows Boot Manager, but have it not load up by default each time the computer reboots?&amp;nbsp; Thanks in advance for the help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Could be the AV did you update it before you run the windows update?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an article that will knock your socks off.&amp;nbsp; Did you know if you have a server that never had an AV installed on it it will never get this patch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reg key you can set.to get the update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so I have various version of windows 10, a few 1511, couple 1603, most either 1703 or 1709.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can someone point me on the best way to setup updating via WSUS, and WSUS only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do NOT want my desktops getting updates from each other, or from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to approve the updates on my WSUS server, and then the PCs download the updates from the WSUS server ..only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a GPO for branchcache already configured, from when I had issues last year with windows updates killing one of my remote sites, but I have a feeling I do not have everything configured the best way, that I may be missing something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;hello all... Can't&amp;nbsp; seem to open up an XML file via the browser on W10? I have checked the default&amp;nbsp;apps and looked into the Associate file type / Protocol with a program. I did, however, find in file type&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;" .Dtd&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;XML Document Type Definition but this does not give me an option to change it to Edge / IE ..&amp;nbsp;What i found strange that this setting on mine allowed me to open it up but no for the given user? Even if i right click on the file and chose open with it will won't load the XML file on chrome or IE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theirs something i missing but i can't put a finger to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any help would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are having issues adding a second Connection Broker to our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 - RDS-Connection Broker - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - RDS- Session Hosts - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Machine we want to add RDS-CB to (RDS-MGR) and is running the SQL Express 2016 for the HA and the OS is Windows 2012 R2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started because we were wanting to move the RDS-CB off of the server it is currently on.&amp;nbsp; (Current server is the DC).&amp;nbsp; So through some investigating we found that the best way to do this is to set up the HA, add the new server, then remove the existing server.&amp;nbsp; We have followed the information at this link: https://thewolfblog.com/2014/02/02/configuring-ha-for-the-remote-desktop-connection-broker/ to a "T" (as well as a few others that were pretty well the same with slight differences).&amp;nbsp; We have been successful in getting the HA configured and the database moved to the SQL Express 2016.&amp;nbsp; We are having issues getting the new server added as a broker now.&amp;nbsp; We are getting an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The database specified in the connection string Driver=SQL Server Native Client 11.0;SERVER=RDS-MGR\RDSQL;Trusted_Connection=Yes;APP=Remote Desktop Services Connection Broker;DATABASE=RDSQL is not available from the RD Connection Broker server RDS-MGR.domain.&amp;nbsp; Ensure that the database server is available on the network, the SQL Server Native Client is installed on all RD Connection Broker servers, and the computer accounts of the RD Connection Broker servers are members of the RDS Management Servers group on the database server."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have created a new separate test server to see if it can be configured as an RDS CB server, and it gets the same error when trying to add it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original CB server and the two new servers all have the SQL client on them and all pass the connection test when going through the ODBC configuration.&amp;nbsp; Firewall has been turned off on all involved servers to ensure that it is not interfering.&amp;nbsp; The test server and new server have been rebooted several times (cannot reboot the original server right now).&amp;nbsp; We have checked that the servers are added to the AD security group that is used in the SQL authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot figure out why this is not connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one...we use a system to manage passwords so admins don't ever actually have their passwords for their privileged accounts, and it grants access to their resources via RDP sessions to a terminal server which launches an application on login without launching the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, this works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently enough, though (usually get at least a couple reports per day), after logging in to the server, the userinit.exe program will get an "Access is denied" error trying to launch the initial program.&amp;nbsp; The login itself is successful as I can open Task Manager and use it to launch Windows Explorer; I can even manually launch the program itself without problems at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses an unprivileged service account, the same one for every application and every person, and passes the password information into the call to the initial program (this has the unfortunate side effect of revealing their current password in the error box that comes up, though it resets every 24 hours).&amp;nbsp; I do see security log audit failures for the service account around the times it acts up.&amp;nbsp; The entries look like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to implement sleep in my domain to save on power costs for my school. Users each have their home folder mapped (N: drive) by GPO's profile tab and a number of other drives mapped by client side preferences, desktop and favourites redirected to folders under N: drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently if I log in and then manually sleep the computer with mapped home drive open in explorer when I wake up, explorer has gone back to the "my computer" view and all mapped drives have red crosses on them. The desktop has also lost connection to the redirected folder. Simply opening a mapped drive will reconnect it, however we have applications that require the mapped drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should mapped drives automatically reconnected when windows 7 resumes from sleep? Or is sleep something that just can not be used with drive maps and redirected documents? Any pointers on potential config issues greatly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Evening,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a RDS server with approx&amp;nbsp; 13-15 users on there at any one time. The server is hightly spec'd ( its a VM) with 16 cores and 76GB of Ram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRM package we are using seems to struggle between&amp;nbsp; when clicking between wwindows ( runs on flat database not SQL ) . They are saying it could be antivirus ( Sophos ) which i have set exclusions to this folder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any ideas? Antivirus issue? CRM Software ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Happened yesterday right after a big Windows update overnight.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, my GPO doesn't have any such policy, I've never set it.&amp;nbsp; I am the admin of this network, and in a few cases I've even expressly permitted the use of USB drives.&amp;nbsp; Brand new drive, straight out of the package.&amp;nbsp; Works on the laptop three feet away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had some recent IT changes which resulted into a few of our members joining the Dev team. They still need access to manager VMs but we do not need them having access to the entire fleet of VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way they can still user Hyper-V management to only see a limited number of VMs chosen by us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Does "honey I told you so" sound familiar.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day at work and get home to "it keeps ASKING me to update windows".&amp;nbsp; Like an idiot I say "you might as well it will force you to eventually".&amp;nbsp; (Win Pro not enterprise so sooner or later it would)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please cue "crap hitting fan"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Explorer re-starts constantly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Then after a few reboots I get into recovery mode (which mind you is a PITA wth happened to whacking on F8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. SFC said (can't find anything and can't finish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. System repair couldn't finish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Tech (me :( ) reboots waits for application error dialog box to come up mbaiapi.dll caused an error in windows explorer and if I leave the dialog box up explorer doesn't bounce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Disable stuff using msconfig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Reboot... and now no login prompt.&amp;nbsp; (well I thought I had checked "hide MS services" but maybe not)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I have a fun weekend task.&amp;nbsp; Any suggestions.&amp;nbsp; I'll be bringing home&amp;nbsp; a stick with 10 on it so I can boot off it but I really will find doing a reset to suck.&amp;nbsp; (I'm going to copy data off it so at least I have t he option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't had this at work going from 1703 to 1709 so I wonder what the heck blew up.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day and really hadn't wanted to do it at home too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was looking for some advice on the best way to deploy a semi-complicated application to our Enterpise environment. Our company just recently upgraded our SCCM to the latest version from SCCM 2007. We are currently in the process of rolling out/testing Windows 10 to about 400 machines. We've slowly been packaging our most used apps, and I put my hand up to try packing probably the most difficult one (at least in my eyes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Document Management System is a horrible program called Autonomy iManege FileSite (or Worksite). We currently have version 8.5 installed on all machines throughout the company as it's part of the MOE. Version 8.5 is made up of three separate installations. FileSite 8.5 itself, FileSite 8.5 Email Management for Outlook, and FileSite 8.5 Web Components. These show up as separate installs in Programs and Features, and we do have the .MSI files for these, so they should be easy to uninstall/supersede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found on Spiceworks: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2162634-deploying-complicated-application-via-sccm-in-enterprise-environment?utm_source=copy_paste&amp;amp;utm_campaign=growth&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ned this to replace many one line emails to everyone i the office with minor notices.&amp;nbsp; Something that would simply pop up an Alert window with a one line message as it does when new email comes in would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have see this question asked and answered on SpiceWorks in several places but most of the info is so old that the products list are no longer made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anything current?&amp;nbsp; Or is Yammer a good alternative as we al have it but no one uses it and i need something so simple Anyone could figure out out with Zero effort.&amp;nbsp; Like sending an email.&amp;nbsp; While I am not looking for an Inter-office Chat app, the ability to reply to an alert&amp;nbsp; would be nice.&amp;nbsp; As would the ability to keep the alert on screen until closed&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Gents&lt;br /&gt;My people report that local files on the server are always opened SECURE in word 2010.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how Office detects that. Where are the flags and can I remove them.&lt;br /&gt;I already run a GPO which defines the server root folder\* as a SECURE place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resaving the DOC seems also not to help but I have to check if saving to DocX helps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are using Office365 with local Outlook 2016 clients. Our spam filtering is Proofpoint. I know Proofpoint can stop an email if it contains private information (credit card #, SSN, bank account, etc). I would like to know if there is anything that can be integrated into Outlook that will trigger a pop-up window to confirm that the user understands the dangers of sending this information?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out how to enable IP source routing protection through GPO in Windows Server 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following instructions I've read online I haven't found this option through the path:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Configuration -&amp;gt; Windows Settings -&amp;gt; Security Settings -&amp;gt; Local Policies -&amp;gt; Security Options -&amp;gt; "MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)" to "Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any links on how exactly to see and enable this option?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at a new company and i asked the manager recently when the last time they changed their passwords and she couldn't remember the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;At the last company i used to work for i had to change them once a month which is fine because i have a good memory and company was an IT company so everyone was tech savvy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked by boss how often he would like me to reset the passwords&amp;nbsp; for all users and he says every 6 months with the exception that him and a few other managers never have to change theirs. Which i don't think is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be my plan of attack so users dont write down their passwords and are well notified so i dont get phone calls throughout the night.&amp;nbsp; Do you think its fair that the managers told me NOT to reset theirs? How often does your company reset passwords?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using WIP rules to protect apps on our enrolled Windows 10 Azure AD joined laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Intune App Protection - Protected apps - "Office-365-ProPlus-1708-Allowed.xml" is on allow list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Office apps are running under Enterprise context and works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When downloading a file via IE/Edge we can only save the file as "Personal" on OneDrive. If drive is saved in Work context OneDrive won't sync the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A policy set by your IT Administrator prevents you from syncing this work file to Onedrive folder"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneDrive.exe is indeed running in enterprise context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain this behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a couple users in a 300+ user environment that are having issues printing from word or outlook or even notepad. When they go to print, upon hitting print the program freezes. When you open the devices and printer window, it takes for ever to load and then it hangs at the end. I've found that when trying to restart the print spooler it comes up with an error 1053: the service did not respond. I've tried enabling the Bluetooth support service and set it to run automatically but that doesn't work. I also found out that you have to try and load the printers and devices, open up the services and attempt to restart the print spooler, wait for it to timeout, refresh the printer and devices window, start the print spooler and then do it all again one more time for it to fix the issue. I'm looking for a permanent fix to this issue. I've tried imagining the computer even reinstalling it from scratch but the error keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Alrighty everyone, here's the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a couple of Windows 10 pro computers, running a second copy of Windows 10 pro within a Hyper-V virtual machine that's connected to a different domain.&amp;nbsp; Both the host machine, and the VM have Office 2016 installed via an Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the host machine, when we right-click on an .xlsx file and select 'print', the Excel file prints successfully to the default printer and if you look in the process list, the Excel.exe process that opens during the print, closes successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the VM, if you attempt the same thing, the excel.exe process does not get closed.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Excel will leave an Excel.exe process open for each file that you right-click &amp;gt; print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this on 2 different workstations set up this way, and both behaved the same way.&amp;nbsp; Both Windows and MS Office have been fully updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an issue as one of our users prints a lot of excel docs and eventually runs out of memory on the VM due to all of the leftover Excel.exe processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find that if you open Excel first and just minimize it, and then right-click &amp;gt; print the .xlsx files you need to print, the Excel.exe processes close properly when they are done being printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround works for now, however it would be great if anyone knows of a way to fix this permanently. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
    <message>&lt;p&gt;David_CSG, yes that did make me chuckle :) The machine is obviously worthless so I'm not too concerned about it but I'm more concerned that I've now had more than one machine bricked in the same way with the old Athlon too. I definately plan to test to old Pentium 4 now as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billh491, yes I was aware of that, that was what I mentioned about the qualitycompat registry key. The Athlon machine didn't have any AV on it at all so nothing to clash but I set the registry key by hand to ensure I got the patch. I can vouch that it doesn't show up without the patch so at least in one of the machine's cases the AV (Bitdefender) is not related to the issue,.&lt;/p&gt;</message>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a recovery partition that I'm testing out on an HP laptop - I used EasyBCD to create a WinPE boot entry and added it to the boot menu.&amp;nbsp; If I leave the settings default, every time the laptop restarts the Windows Boot Manager will appear and wait 30 seconds (or however long I set it) for me to pick to boot to Windows 10, or to the WinPE recovery partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to do is set the boot menu to not appear by default, and simply be able to call it up if/when it's needed.&amp;nbsp; I have not been able to find any keyboard shortcuts that will bring up the boot menu (only the Advanced Startup).&amp;nbsp; Is there a way to manually load the Windows Boot Manager, but have it not load up by default each time the computer reboots?&amp;nbsp; Thanks in advance for the help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so I have various version of windows 10, a few 1511, couple 1603, most either 1703 or 1709.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can someone point me on the best way to setup updating via WSUS, and WSUS only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do NOT want my desktops getting updates from each other, or from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to approve the updates on my WSUS server, and then the PCs download the updates from the WSUS server ..only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a GPO for branchcache already configured, from when I had issues last year with windows updates killing one of my remote sites, but I have a feeling I do not have everything configured the best way, that I may be missing something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;hello all... Can't&amp;nbsp; seem to open up an XML file via the browser on W10? I have checked the default&amp;nbsp;apps and looked into the Associate file type / Protocol with a program. I did, however, find in file type&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;" .Dtd&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;XML Document Type Definition but this does not give me an option to change it to Edge / IE ..&amp;nbsp;What i found strange that this setting on mine allowed me to open it up but no for the given user? Even if i right click on the file and chose open with it will won't load the XML file on chrome or IE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theirs something i missing but i can't put a finger to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are having issues adding a second Connection Broker to our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 - RDS-Connection Broker - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - RDS- Session Hosts - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Machine we want to add RDS-CB to (RDS-MGR) and is running the SQL Express 2016 for the HA and the OS is Windows 2012 R2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started because we were wanting to move the RDS-CB off of the server it is currently on.&amp;nbsp; (Current server is the DC).&amp;nbsp; So through some investigating we found that the best way to do this is to set up the HA, add the new server, then remove the existing server.&amp;nbsp; We have followed the information at this link: https://thewolfblog.com/2014/02/02/configuring-ha-for-the-remote-desktop-connection-broker/ to a "T" (as well as a few others that were pretty well the same with slight differences).&amp;nbsp; We have been successful in getting the HA configured and the database moved to the SQL Express 2016.&amp;nbsp; We are having issues getting the new server added as a broker now.&amp;nbsp; We are getting an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The database specified in the connection string Driver=SQL Server Native Client 11.0;SERVER=RDS-MGR\RDSQL;Trusted_Connection=Yes;APP=Remote Desktop Services Connection Broker;DATABASE=RDSQL is not available from the RD Connection Broker server RDS-MGR.domain.&amp;nbsp; Ensure that the database server is available on the network, the SQL Server Native Client is installed on all RD Connection Broker servers, and the computer accounts of the RD Connection Broker servers are members of the RDS Management Servers group on the database server."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have created a new separate test server to see if it can be configured as an RDS CB server, and it gets the same error when trying to add it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original CB server and the two new servers all have the SQL client on them and all pass the connection test when going through the ODBC configuration.&amp;nbsp; Firewall has been turned off on all involved servers to ensure that it is not interfering.&amp;nbsp; The test server and new server have been rebooted several times (cannot reboot the original server right now).&amp;nbsp; We have checked that the servers are added to the AD security group that is used in the SQL authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot figure out why this is not connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one...we use a system to manage passwords so admins don't ever actually have their passwords for their privileged accounts, and it grants access to their resources via RDP sessions to a terminal server which launches an application on login without launching the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, this works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently enough, though (usually get at least a couple reports per day), after logging in to the server, the userinit.exe program will get an "Access is denied" error trying to launch the initial program.&amp;nbsp; The login itself is successful as I can open Task Manager and use it to launch Windows Explorer; I can even manually launch the program itself without problems at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses an unprivileged service account, the same one for every application and every person, and passes the password information into the call to the initial program (this has the unfortunate side effect of revealing their current password in the error box that comes up, though it resets every 24 hours).&amp;nbsp; I do see security log audit failures for the service account around the times it acts up.&amp;nbsp; The entries look like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to implement sleep in my domain to save on power costs for my school. Users each have their home folder mapped (N: drive) by GPO's profile tab and a number of other drives mapped by client side preferences, desktop and favourites redirected to folders under N: drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently if I log in and then manually sleep the computer with mapped home drive open in explorer when I wake up, explorer has gone back to the "my computer" view and all mapped drives have red crosses on them. The desktop has also lost connection to the redirected folder. Simply opening a mapped drive will reconnect it, however we have applications that require the mapped drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should mapped drives automatically reconnected when windows 7 resumes from sleep? Or is sleep something that just can not be used with drive maps and redirected documents? Any pointers on potential config issues greatly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Evening,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a RDS server with approx&amp;nbsp; 13-15 users on there at any one time. The server is hightly spec'd ( its a VM) with 16 cores and 76GB of Ram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRM package we are using seems to struggle between&amp;nbsp; when clicking between wwindows ( runs on flat database not SQL ) . They are saying it could be antivirus ( Sophos ) which i have set exclusions to this folder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had some recent IT changes which resulted into a few of our members joining the Dev team. They still need access to manager VMs but we do not need them having access to the entire fleet of VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way they can still user Hyper-V management to only see a limited number of VMs chosen by us?&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Does "honey I told you so" sound familiar.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day at work and get home to "it keeps ASKING me to update windows".&amp;nbsp; Like an idiot I say "you might as well it will force you to eventually".&amp;nbsp; (Win Pro not enterprise so sooner or later it would)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please cue "crap hitting fan"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Explorer re-starts constantly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Then after a few reboots I get into recovery mode (which mind you is a PITA wth happened to whacking on F8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. SFC said (can't find anything and can't finish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. System repair couldn't finish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Tech (me :( ) reboots waits for application error dialog box to come up mbaiapi.dll caused an error in windows explorer and if I leave the dialog box up explorer doesn't bounce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Disable stuff using msconfig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Reboot... and now no login prompt.&amp;nbsp; (well I thought I had checked "hide MS services" but maybe not)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I have a fun weekend task.&amp;nbsp; Any suggestions.&amp;nbsp; I'll be bringing home&amp;nbsp; a stick with 10 on it so I can boot off it but I really will find doing a reset to suck.&amp;nbsp; (I'm going to copy data off it so at least I have t he option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't had this at work going from 1703 to 1709 so I wonder what the heck blew up.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day and really hadn't wanted to do it at home too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was looking for some advice on the best way to deploy a semi-complicated application to our Enterpise environment. Our company just recently upgraded our SCCM to the latest version from SCCM 2007. We are currently in the process of rolling out/testing Windows 10 to about 400 machines. We've slowly been packaging our most used apps, and I put my hand up to try packing probably the most difficult one (at least in my eyes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Document Management System is a horrible program called Autonomy iManege FileSite (or Worksite). We currently have version 8.5 installed on all machines throughout the company as it's part of the MOE. Version 8.5 is made up of three separate installations. FileSite 8.5 itself, FileSite 8.5 Email Management for Outlook, and FileSite 8.5 Web Components. These show up as separate installs in Programs and Features, and we do have the .MSI files for these, so they should be easy to uninstall/supersede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found on Spiceworks: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2162634-deploying-complicated-application-via-sccm-in-enterprise-environment?utm_source=copy_paste&amp;amp;utm_campaign=growth&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billh491, yes I was aware of that, that was what I mentioned about the qualitycompat registry key. The Athlon machine didn't have any AV on it at all so nothing to clash but I set the registry key by hand to ensure I got the patch. I can vouch that it doesn't show up without the patch so at least in one of the machine's cases the AV (Bitdefender) is not related to the issue,.&lt;/p&gt;</message>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ned this to replace many one line emails to everyone i the office with minor notices.&amp;nbsp; Something that would simply pop up an Alert window with a one line message as it does when new email comes in would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have see this question asked and answered on SpiceWorks in several places but most of the info is so old that the products list are no longer made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anything current?&amp;nbsp; Or is Yammer a good alternative as we al have it but no one uses it and i need something so simple Anyone could figure out out with Zero effort.&amp;nbsp; Like sending an email.&amp;nbsp; While I am not looking for an Inter-office Chat app, the ability to reply to an alert&amp;nbsp; would be nice.&amp;nbsp; As would the ability to keep the alert on screen until closed&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Gents&lt;br /&gt;My people report that local files on the server are always opened SECURE in word 2010.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how Office detects that. Where are the flags and can I remove them.&lt;br /&gt;I already run a GPO which defines the server root folder\* as a SECURE place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out how to enable IP source routing protection through GPO in Windows Server 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following instructions I've read online I haven't found this option through the path:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Configuration -&amp;gt; Windows Settings -&amp;gt; Security Settings -&amp;gt; Local Policies -&amp;gt; Security Options -&amp;gt; "MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)" to "Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled".&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at a new company and i asked the manager recently when the last time they changed their passwords and she couldn't remember the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;At the last company i used to work for i had to change them once a month which is fine because i have a good memory and company was an IT company so everyone was tech savvy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked by boss how often he would like me to reset the passwords&amp;nbsp; for all users and he says every 6 months with the exception that him and a few other managers never have to change theirs. Which i don't think is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be my plan of attack so users dont write down their passwords and are well notified so i dont get phone calls throughout the night.&amp;nbsp; Do you think its fair that the managers told me NOT to reset theirs? How often does your company reset passwords?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using WIP rules to protect apps on our enrolled Windows 10 Azure AD joined laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Intune App Protection - Protected apps - "Office-365-ProPlus-1708-Allowed.xml" is on allow list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Office apps are running under Enterprise context and works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When downloading a file via IE/Edge we can only save the file as "Personal" on OneDrive. If drive is saved in Work context OneDrive won't sync the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A policy set by your IT Administrator prevents you from syncing this work file to Onedrive folder"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneDrive.exe is indeed running in enterprise context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain this behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a couple users in a 300+ user environment that are having issues printing from word or outlook or even notepad. When they go to print, upon hitting print the program freezes. When you open the devices and printer window, it takes for ever to load and then it hangs at the end. I've found that when trying to restart the print spooler it comes up with an error 1053: the service did not respond. I've tried enabling the Bluetooth support service and set it to run automatically but that doesn't work. I also found out that you have to try and load the printers and devices, open up the services and attempt to restart the print spooler, wait for it to timeout, refresh the printer and devices window, start the print spooler and then do it all again one more time for it to fix the issue. I'm looking for a permanent fix to this issue. I've tried imagining the computer even reinstalling it from scratch but the error keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Alrighty everyone, here's the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a couple of Windows 10 pro computers, running a second copy of Windows 10 pro within a Hyper-V virtual machine that's connected to a different domain.&amp;nbsp; Both the host machine, and the VM have Office 2016 installed via an Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the host machine, when we right-click on an .xlsx file and select 'print', the Excel file prints successfully to the default printer and if you look in the process list, the Excel.exe process that opens during the print, closes successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the VM, if you attempt the same thing, the excel.exe process does not get closed.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Excel will leave an Excel.exe process open for each file that you right-click &amp;gt; print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this on 2 different workstations set up this way, and both behaved the same way.&amp;nbsp; Both Windows and MS Office have been fully updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an issue as one of our users prints a lot of excel docs and eventually runs out of memory on the VM due to all of the leftover Excel.exe processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find that if you open Excel first and just minimize it, and then right-click &amp;gt; print the .xlsx files you need to print, the Excel.exe processes close properly when they are done being printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround works for now, however it would be great if anyone knows of a way to fix this permanently. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a recovery partition that I'm testing out on an HP laptop - I used EasyBCD to create a WinPE boot entry and added it to the boot menu.&amp;nbsp; If I leave the settings default, every time the laptop restarts the Windows Boot Manager will appear and wait 30 seconds (or however long I set it) for me to pick to boot to Windows 10, or to the WinPE recovery partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to do is set the boot menu to not appear by default, and simply be able to call it up if/when it's needed.&amp;nbsp; I have not been able to find any keyboard shortcuts that will bring up the boot menu (only the Advanced Startup).&amp;nbsp; Is there a way to manually load the Windows Boot Manager, but have it not load up by default each time the computer reboots?&amp;nbsp; Thanks in advance for the help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ha! SSD is an old IDE Pentium 3? I think an IDE SSD would be worth more than the whole laptop :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh install is a good idea though. I might try that when I get five mins (hours?).&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so I have various version of windows 10, a few 1511, couple 1603, most either 1703 or 1709.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can someone point me on the best way to setup updating via WSUS, and WSUS only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do NOT want my desktops getting updates from each other, or from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to approve the updates on my WSUS server, and then the PCs download the updates from the WSUS server ..only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a GPO for branchcache already configured, from when I had issues last year with windows updates killing one of my remote sites, but I have a feeling I do not have everything configured the best way, that I may be missing something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;hello all... Can't&amp;nbsp; seem to open up an XML file via the browser on W10? I have checked the default&amp;nbsp;apps and looked into the Associate file type / Protocol with a program. I did, however, find in file type&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;" .Dtd&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;XML Document Type Definition but this does not give me an option to change it to Edge / IE ..&amp;nbsp;What i found strange that this setting on mine allowed me to open it up but no for the given user? Even if i right click on the file and chose open with it will won't load the XML file on chrome or IE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theirs something i missing but i can't put a finger to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any help would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are having issues adding a second Connection Broker to our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 - RDS-Connection Broker - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - RDS- Session Hosts - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Machine we want to add RDS-CB to (RDS-MGR) and is running the SQL Express 2016 for the HA and the OS is Windows 2012 R2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started because we were wanting to move the RDS-CB off of the server it is currently on.&amp;nbsp; (Current server is the DC).&amp;nbsp; So through some investigating we found that the best way to do this is to set up the HA, add the new server, then remove the existing server.&amp;nbsp; We have followed the information at this link: https://thewolfblog.com/2014/02/02/configuring-ha-for-the-remote-desktop-connection-broker/ to a "T" (as well as a few others that were pretty well the same with slight differences).&amp;nbsp; We have been successful in getting the HA configured and the database moved to the SQL Express 2016.&amp;nbsp; We are having issues getting the new server added as a broker now.&amp;nbsp; We are getting an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The database specified in the connection string Driver=SQL Server Native Client 11.0;SERVER=RDS-MGR\RDSQL;Trusted_Connection=Yes;APP=Remote Desktop Services Connection Broker;DATABASE=RDSQL is not available from the RD Connection Broker server RDS-MGR.domain.&amp;nbsp; Ensure that the database server is available on the network, the SQL Server Native Client is installed on all RD Connection Broker servers, and the computer accounts of the RD Connection Broker servers are members of the RDS Management Servers group on the database server."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have created a new separate test server to see if it can be configured as an RDS CB server, and it gets the same error when trying to add it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original CB server and the two new servers all have the SQL client on them and all pass the connection test when going through the ODBC configuration.&amp;nbsp; Firewall has been turned off on all involved servers to ensure that it is not interfering.&amp;nbsp; The test server and new server have been rebooted several times (cannot reboot the original server right now).&amp;nbsp; We have checked that the servers are added to the AD security group that is used in the SQL authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot figure out why this is not connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one...we use a system to manage passwords so admins don't ever actually have their passwords for their privileged accounts, and it grants access to their resources via RDP sessions to a terminal server which launches an application on login without launching the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, this works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently enough, though (usually get at least a couple reports per day), after logging in to the server, the userinit.exe program will get an "Access is denied" error trying to launch the initial program.&amp;nbsp; The login itself is successful as I can open Task Manager and use it to launch Windows Explorer; I can even manually launch the program itself without problems at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses an unprivileged service account, the same one for every application and every person, and passes the password information into the call to the initial program (this has the unfortunate side effect of revealing their current password in the error box that comes up, though it resets every 24 hours).&amp;nbsp; I do see security log audit failures for the service account around the times it acts up.&amp;nbsp; The entries look like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to implement sleep in my domain to save on power costs for my school. Users each have their home folder mapped (N: drive) by GPO's profile tab and a number of other drives mapped by client side preferences, desktop and favourites redirected to folders under N: drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently if I log in and then manually sleep the computer with mapped home drive open in explorer when I wake up, explorer has gone back to the "my computer" view and all mapped drives have red crosses on them. The desktop has also lost connection to the redirected folder. Simply opening a mapped drive will reconnect it, however we have applications that require the mapped drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should mapped drives automatically reconnected when windows 7 resumes from sleep? Or is sleep something that just can not be used with drive maps and redirected documents? Any pointers on potential config issues greatly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Evening,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a RDS server with approx&amp;nbsp; 13-15 users on there at any one time. The server is hightly spec'd ( its a VM) with 16 cores and 76GB of Ram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRM package we are using seems to struggle between&amp;nbsp; when clicking between wwindows ( runs on flat database not SQL ) . They are saying it could be antivirus ( Sophos ) which i have set exclusions to this folder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any ideas? Antivirus issue? CRM Software ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Happened yesterday right after a big Windows update overnight.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, my GPO doesn't have any such policy, I've never set it.&amp;nbsp; I am the admin of this network, and in a few cases I've even expressly permitted the use of USB drives.&amp;nbsp; Brand new drive, straight out of the package.&amp;nbsp; Works on the laptop three feet away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had some recent IT changes which resulted into a few of our members joining the Dev team. They still need access to manager VMs but we do not need them having access to the entire fleet of VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way they can still user Hyper-V management to only see a limited number of VMs chosen by us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Does "honey I told you so" sound familiar.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day at work and get home to "it keeps ASKING me to update windows".&amp;nbsp; Like an idiot I say "you might as well it will force you to eventually".&amp;nbsp; (Win Pro not enterprise so sooner or later it would)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please cue "crap hitting fan"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Explorer re-starts constantly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Then after a few reboots I get into recovery mode (which mind you is a PITA wth happened to whacking on F8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. SFC said (can't find anything and can't finish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. System repair couldn't finish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Tech (me :( ) reboots waits for application error dialog box to come up mbaiapi.dll caused an error in windows explorer and if I leave the dialog box up explorer doesn't bounce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Disable stuff using msconfig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Reboot... and now no login prompt.&amp;nbsp; (well I thought I had checked "hide MS services" but maybe not)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I have a fun weekend task.&amp;nbsp; Any suggestions.&amp;nbsp; I'll be bringing home&amp;nbsp; a stick with 10 on it so I can boot off it but I really will find doing a reset to suck.&amp;nbsp; (I'm going to copy data off it so at least I have t he option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't had this at work going from 1703 to 1709 so I wonder what the heck blew up.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day and really hadn't wanted to do it at home too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was looking for some advice on the best way to deploy a semi-complicated application to our Enterpise environment. Our company just recently upgraded our SCCM to the latest version from SCCM 2007. We are currently in the process of rolling out/testing Windows 10 to about 400 machines. We've slowly been packaging our most used apps, and I put my hand up to try packing probably the most difficult one (at least in my eyes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Document Management System is a horrible program called Autonomy iManege FileSite (or Worksite). We currently have version 8.5 installed on all machines throughout the company as it's part of the MOE. Version 8.5 is made up of three separate installations. FileSite 8.5 itself, FileSite 8.5 Email Management for Outlook, and FileSite 8.5 Web Components. These show up as separate installs in Programs and Features, and we do have the .MSI files for these, so they should be easy to uninstall/supersede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found on Spiceworks: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2162634-deploying-complicated-application-via-sccm-in-enterprise-environment?utm_source=copy_paste&amp;amp;utm_campaign=growth&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ha! SSD is an old IDE Pentium 3? I think an IDE SSD would be worth more than the whole laptop :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh install is a good idea though. I might try that when I get five mins (hours?).&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ned this to replace many one line emails to everyone i the office with minor notices.&amp;nbsp; Something that would simply pop up an Alert window with a one line message as it does when new email comes in would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have see this question asked and answered on SpiceWorks in several places but most of the info is so old that the products list are no longer made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anything current?&amp;nbsp; Or is Yammer a good alternative as we al have it but no one uses it and i need something so simple Anyone could figure out out with Zero effort.&amp;nbsp; Like sending an email.&amp;nbsp; While I am not looking for an Inter-office Chat app, the ability to reply to an alert&amp;nbsp; would be nice.&amp;nbsp; As would the ability to keep the alert on screen until closed&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Gents&lt;br /&gt;My people report that local files on the server are always opened SECURE in word 2010.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder how Office detects that. Where are the flags and can I remove them.&lt;br /&gt;I already run a GPO which defines the server root folder\* as a SECURE place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resaving the DOC seems also not to help but I have to check if saving to DocX helps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are using Office365 with local Outlook 2016 clients. Our spam filtering is Proofpoint. I know Proofpoint can stop an email if it contains private information (credit card #, SSN, bank account, etc). I would like to know if there is anything that can be integrated into Outlook that will trigger a pop-up window to confirm that the user understands the dangers of sending this information?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out how to enable IP source routing protection through GPO in Windows Server 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following instructions I've read online I haven't found this option through the path:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Configuration -&amp;gt; Windows Settings -&amp;gt; Security Settings -&amp;gt; Local Policies -&amp;gt; Security Options -&amp;gt; "MSS: (DisableIPSourceRouting) IP source routing protection level (protects against packet spoofing)" to "Highest protection, source routing is completely disabled".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any links on how exactly to see and enable this option?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
    <message>&lt;p&gt;RIGHT ! Well I was obviously pre-caffeinated when I first replied...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could come down to a question of how valuable your time is, vs. cost of a new unit that could take the place of the existing one. It might just be time to move on up ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally thinking if you had an SSD kicking around (eg a smaller one pulled out of another unit), but in that laptop, you'd have to get a converter board/adapter and mount the SSD in the optical drive bay... and given the age of the hardware it'd sure be a pursuit of diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;</message>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started at a new company and i asked the manager recently when the last time they changed their passwords and she couldn't remember the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;At the last company i used to work for i had to change them once a month which is fine because i have a good memory and company was an IT company so everyone was tech savvy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've asked by boss how often he would like me to reset the passwords&amp;nbsp; for all users and he says every 6 months with the exception that him and a few other managers never have to change theirs. Which i don't think is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be my plan of attack so users dont write down their passwords and are well notified so i dont get phone calls throughout the night.&amp;nbsp; Do you think its fair that the managers told me NOT to reset theirs? How often does your company reset passwords?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using WIP rules to protect apps on our enrolled Windows 10 Azure AD joined laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Intune App Protection - Protected apps - "Office-365-ProPlus-1708-Allowed.xml" is on allow list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Office apps are running under Enterprise context and works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When downloading a file via IE/Edge we can only save the file as "Personal" on OneDrive. If drive is saved in Work context OneDrive won't sync the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A policy set by your IT Administrator prevents you from syncing this work file to Onedrive folder"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OneDrive.exe is indeed running in enterprise context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain this behaviour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a couple users in a 300+ user environment that are having issues printing from word or outlook or even notepad. When they go to print, upon hitting print the program freezes. When you open the devices and printer window, it takes for ever to load and then it hangs at the end. I've found that when trying to restart the print spooler it comes up with an error 1053: the service did not respond. I've tried enabling the Bluetooth support service and set it to run automatically but that doesn't work. I also found out that you have to try and load the printers and devices, open up the services and attempt to restart the print spooler, wait for it to timeout, refresh the printer and devices window, start the print spooler and then do it all again one more time for it to fix the issue. I'm looking for a permanent fix to this issue. I've tried imagining the computer even reinstalling it from scratch but the error keeps coming back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Alrighty everyone, here's the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a couple of Windows 10 pro computers, running a second copy of Windows 10 pro within a Hyper-V virtual machine that's connected to a different domain.&amp;nbsp; Both the host machine, and the VM have Office 2016 installed via an Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the host machine, when we right-click on an .xlsx file and select 'print', the Excel file prints successfully to the default printer and if you look in the process list, the Excel.exe process that opens during the print, closes successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the VM, if you attempt the same thing, the excel.exe process does not get closed.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Excel will leave an Excel.exe process open for each file that you right-click &amp;gt; print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this on 2 different workstations set up this way, and both behaved the same way.&amp;nbsp; Both Windows and MS Office have been fully updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an issue as one of our users prints a lot of excel docs and eventually runs out of memory on the VM due to all of the leftover Excel.exe processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find that if you open Excel first and just minimize it, and then right-click &amp;gt; print the .xlsx files you need to print, the Excel.exe processes close properly when they are done being printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround works for now, however it would be great if anyone knows of a way to fix this permanently. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a recovery partition that I'm testing out on an HP laptop - I used EasyBCD to create a WinPE boot entry and added it to the boot menu.&amp;nbsp; If I leave the settings default, every time the laptop restarts the Windows Boot Manager will appear and wait 30 seconds (or however long I set it) for me to pick to boot to Windows 10, or to the WinPE recovery partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to do is set the boot menu to not appear by default, and simply be able to call it up if/when it's needed.&amp;nbsp; I have not been able to find any keyboard shortcuts that will bring up the boot menu (only the Advanced Startup).&amp;nbsp; Is there a way to manually load the Windows Boot Manager, but have it not load up by default each time the computer reboots?&amp;nbsp; Thanks in advance for the help!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;so I have various version of windows 10, a few 1511, couple 1603, most either 1703 or 1709.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can someone point me on the best way to setup updating via WSUS, and WSUS only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do NOT want my desktops getting updates from each other, or from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to approve the updates on my WSUS server, and then the PCs download the updates from the WSUS server ..only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a GPO for branchcache already configured, from when I had issues last year with windows updates killing one of my remote sites, but I have a feeling I do not have everything configured the best way, that I may be missing something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;hello all... Can't&amp;nbsp; seem to open up an XML file via the browser on W10? I have checked the default&amp;nbsp;apps and looked into the Associate file type / Protocol with a program. I did, however, find in file type&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;" .Dtd&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;XML Document Type Definition but this does not give me an option to change it to Edge / IE ..&amp;nbsp;What i found strange that this setting on mine allowed me to open it up but no for the given user? Even if i right click on the file and chose open with it will won't load the XML file on chrome or IE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theirs something i missing but i can't put a finger to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are having issues adding a second Connection Broker to our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 - RDS-Connection Broker - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - RDS- Session Hosts - Windows 2012 R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Machine we want to add RDS-CB to (RDS-MGR) and is running the SQL Express 2016 for the HA and the OS is Windows 2012 R2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started because we were wanting to move the RDS-CB off of the server it is currently on.&amp;nbsp; (Current server is the DC).&amp;nbsp; So through some investigating we found that the best way to do this is to set up the HA, add the new server, then remove the existing server.&amp;nbsp; We have followed the information at this link: https://thewolfblog.com/2014/02/02/configuring-ha-for-the-remote-desktop-connection-broker/ to a "T" (as well as a few others that were pretty well the same with slight differences).&amp;nbsp; We have been successful in getting the HA configured and the database moved to the SQL Express 2016.&amp;nbsp; We are having issues getting the new server added as a broker now.&amp;nbsp; We are getting an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The database specified in the connection string Driver=SQL Server Native Client 11.0;SERVER=RDS-MGR\RDSQL;Trusted_Connection=Yes;APP=Remote Desktop Services Connection Broker;DATABASE=RDSQL is not available from the RD Connection Broker server RDS-MGR.domain.&amp;nbsp; Ensure that the database server is available on the network, the SQL Server Native Client is installed on all RD Connection Broker servers, and the computer accounts of the RD Connection Broker servers are members of the RDS Management Servers group on the database server."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have created a new separate test server to see if it can be configured as an RDS CB server, and it gets the same error when trying to add it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original CB server and the two new servers all have the SQL client on them and all pass the connection test when going through the ODBC configuration.&amp;nbsp; Firewall has been turned off on all involved servers to ensure that it is not interfering.&amp;nbsp; The test server and new server have been rebooted several times (cannot reboot the original server right now).&amp;nbsp; We have checked that the servers are added to the AD security group that is used in the SQL authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot figure out why this is not connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one...we use a system to manage passwords so admins don't ever actually have their passwords for their privileged accounts, and it grants access to their resources via RDP sessions to a terminal server which launches an application on login without launching the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, this works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently enough, though (usually get at least a couple reports per day), after logging in to the server, the userinit.exe program will get an "Access is denied" error trying to launch the initial program.&amp;nbsp; The login itself is successful as I can open Task Manager and use it to launch Windows Explorer; I can even manually launch the program itself without problems at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses an unprivileged service account, the same one for every application and every person, and passes the password information into the call to the initial program (this has the unfortunate side effect of revealing their current password in the error box that comes up, though it resets every 24 hours).&amp;nbsp; I do see security log audit failures for the service account around the times it acts up.&amp;nbsp; The entries look like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to implement sleep in my domain to save on power costs for my school. Users each have their home folder mapped (N: drive) by GPO's profile tab and a number of other drives mapped by client side preferences, desktop and favourites redirected to folders under N: drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently if I log in and then manually sleep the computer with mapped home drive open in explorer when I wake up, explorer has gone back to the "my computer" view and all mapped drives have red crosses on them. The desktop has also lost connection to the redirected folder. Simply opening a mapped drive will reconnect it, however we have applications that require the mapped drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should mapped drives automatically reconnected when windows 7 resumes from sleep? Or is sleep something that just can not be used with drive maps and redirected documents? Any pointers on potential config issues greatly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Evening,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a RDS server with approx&amp;nbsp; 13-15 users on there at any one time. The server is hightly spec'd ( its a VM) with 16 cores and 76GB of Ram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRM package we are using seems to struggle between&amp;nbsp; when clicking between wwindows ( runs on flat database not SQL ) . They are saying it could be antivirus ( Sophos ) which i have set exclusions to this folder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any ideas? Antivirus issue? CRM Software ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had some recent IT changes which resulted into a few of our members joining the Dev team. They still need access to manager VMs but we do not need them having access to the entire fleet of VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way they can still user Hyper-V management to only see a limited number of VMs chosen by us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please cue "crap hitting fan"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Explorer re-starts constantly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Then after a few reboots I get into recovery mode (which mind you is a PITA wth happened to whacking on F8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. SFC said (can't find anything and can't finish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. System repair couldn't finish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 Tech (me :( ) reboots waits for application error dialog box to come up mbaiapi.dll caused an error in windows explorer and if I leave the dialog box up explorer doesn't bounce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Disable stuff using msconfig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Reboot... and now no login prompt.&amp;nbsp; (well I thought I had checked "hide MS services" but maybe not)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that I have a fun weekend task.&amp;nbsp; Any suggestions.&amp;nbsp; I'll be bringing home&amp;nbsp; a stick with 10 on it so I can boot off it but I really will find doing a reset to suck.&amp;nbsp; (I'm going to copy data off it so at least I have t he option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't had this at work going from 1703 to 1709 so I wonder what the heck blew up.&amp;nbsp; I do this all day and really hadn't wanted to do it at home too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was looking for some advice on the best way to deploy a semi-complicated application to our Enterpise environment. Our company just recently upgraded our SCCM to the latest version from SCCM 2007. We are currently in the process of rolling out/testing Windows 10 to about 400 machines. We've slowly been packaging our most used apps, and I put my hand up to try packing probably the most difficult one (at least in my eyes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Document Management System is a horrible program called Autonomy iManege FileSite (or Worksite). We currently have version 8.5 installed on all machines throughout the company as it's part of the MOE. Version 8.5 is made up of three separate installations. FileSite 8.5 itself, FileSite 8.5 Email Management for Outlook, and FileSite 8.5 Web Components. These show up as separate installs in Programs and Features, and we do have the .MSI files for these, so they should be easy to uninstall/supersede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found on Spiceworks: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2162634-deploying-complicated-application-via-sccm-in-enterprise-environment?utm_source=copy_paste&amp;amp;utm_campaign=growth&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ned this to replace many one line emails to everyone i the office with minor notices.&amp;nbsp; Something that would simply pop up an Alert window with a one line message as it does when new email comes in would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have see this question asked and answered on SpiceWorks in several places but most of the info is so old that the products list are no longer made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is anything current?&amp;nbsp; Or is Yammer a good alternative as we al have it but no one uses it and i need something so simple Anyone could figure out out with Zero effort.&amp;nbsp; Like sending an email.&amp;nbsp; While I am not looking for an Inter-office Chat app, the ability to reply to an alert&amp;nbsp; would be nice.&amp;nbsp; As would the ability to keep the alert on screen until closed&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we are starting to use more and more Windows 10 machines than Windows 7 and starting to notice some policies that aren't carrying over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user logs into a Windows 7 machine, it adds folders to the start menu with shortcuts to specific websites. There are a few folders that have the same URL as other folders. This is intention as we want our users to look up the site by the product name even though some of the products all use the same URL on the back end. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 1&lt;br /&gt;URL 1&lt;br /&gt;Product 2URL 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've noticed in our Windows 10 (1709) machines that it only list duplicate URLs once. Even if the URL shortcuts have different names, it will only show one shortcut to the website instead of the many shortcuts of the same URL with different names.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something? Is this intention and if so, does anyone know a way around this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have some users that are running some very resource intensive processes which often consume many GBs worth of RAM. Often times a user will run a job which ends up consuming close to 100% of the system's RAM (which in our case is around 100GB). The issue in our case, is the disparity between what the user sees reported in Task Manager vs what I (the admin) see reported in Resource Monitor. Task Monitor is reporting that the user's process is using 1.3GB of RAM while Resource Monitor reports the process has 3.7GB committed to memory and 100GB in working memory. Because the user is not able to see this memory issue in Task Manager, they assume the issue is caused by other users on the VM. Without having admin privileges, are there any good ways for a user to view more info on their RAM usage?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I am having an issue installing a local printer on a Windows 7 machine. This is the second time this has happened. I am logged in as a domain admin onto a domain machine with Windows 7 64-bit. When I go to install the printer I receive the error "Printer driver was not installed. Access is denied." Both times this has happened it was a Win 7 machine connecting to a Brother printer. The first time it happened I pounded my head against it for a couple of hours and after restarting the printer it worked. This time no amount of GPO changes, clearing drivers, changing admin accounts, rebooting of laptop or printer will make it work. The laptop can reach the PC I just can't install the drivers and I'm the admin. What am I missing?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I am having an administrative issue at the moment. I have an end user who wants to have FileZilla installed on her PC in order to get some work done with one of her outside clients. The 2&amp;nbsp;SFTP clients I am reviewing at the moment are WinSCP and FIleZilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about the safety of these clients and I want to be certain that all my end users see is what is designated for her to be able to see. I do have the server information in order to pull files but I am concerned that there may be a file there that does not belong there since it is not something on our network and we have no control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is to be able to keep our network secure and to prohibit her from downloading any files that can possibly execute code. We do have Symantec Endpoint protection in place but I am not certain that will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to set out a proactive standard when it comes to this type of client. So basically what I want to do is have whatever may be the safest and most supported client in this environment and to prevent any malicious content from being downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note is when I downloaded FileZilla, Symantec found and quarantined the following file, "marutono.exe"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded FileZilla from the below site&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are an SCCM shop and are growing into the cloud arena. I'm looking at Microsoft's AutoPilot feature. We should have everything we need to proceed... SCCM (yes, I know, optional), Azure Premium, and Intune (another option from what I understand). I'm really looking forward to getting things rolling, but before I do, I'd love to hear from those who are actually using it on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some general questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do home-brewed applications work? What are your most common issues?&lt;br /&gt;Are users trying work arounds?&lt;br /&gt;If so, what kind and what have you done to curb this?&lt;br /&gt;How big are your organizations?&lt;br /&gt;Do you use the whole program, or do you use pieces?&lt;br /&gt;Any other tips or suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;How long have you been using it?&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I've read many an article with all great reviews, but since it's such a new product, I'd love to hear from you that actually use it and what you really think.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of adding a new larger RAID to our server.&amp;nbsp; Set-up is a Dell PE T610 running Server 2008 R2 on the physical machine hosting a 2012 R2 Essentials VM through HyperV.&amp;nbsp; Currently has a PERC H200 card and 4TB RAID10 that I'm replacing with am H710 card and 8TB RAID10.&amp;nbsp; Due to changing controller cards (and purposely not attempting the unsupported foreign config import from the H200 to H710), and wanting to be able to completely revert back to the old setup if things go sideways, my only option is to copy the VM to an external USB drive, disconnect the old RAID, connect the new RAID, copy the VM back to the new RAID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is, HOW to do this exactly.&amp;nbsp; And what is the most reliable and least complicated method.&amp;nbsp; I've been reading everything I can find, but there is precious little info on re-importing a VM to the exact same physical host.&amp;nbsp; I know simply copying the .vhd files to the new RAID and pointing the VM to them does not work.&amp;nbsp; The only other things I've been able to ascertain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; I can re-import the exact same VM to the new location, but FIRST I have to delete the old VM from HYPV manager.&amp;nbsp; I'm not comfortable doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; I can import the VM as a NEW VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm concerned about all of the issues that might crop up with having a new VM.&amp;nbsp; For instanc, I remember reading something about an issue with the virtual network card and MAC address.&amp;nbsp; Will I have to reconnect all of the client computers?&amp;nbsp; Will I have to re-set-up remote web access/remote client access?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm hoping there's away to accomplish option 1 without having to permanently delete the old VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm open to any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we have a two node 2012 R2 Cluster. We are using Starwinds for shared storage. We have 10 VM roles, 1 dhcp server role and 3 Scale out file server Roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal is to provide maximum up time for the VM's and some important file shares.&amp;nbsp; The file share data is actually more important than the VM's. The shares are users, projects and operations.&amp;nbsp; Each share is 1.5 TB max with around 300GB used on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why, but when we originally designed this, Starwinds highly recommended that we create the file shares using the scale out file server role vs using the standard file server role or creating a "VM File server" to share the files.&amp;nbsp; So right now each of the shares is on a SOFS Role and shared to the users from there. From everything I've read this is NOT the way file server user shares should be setup. See&amp;nbsp;when to use a SOFS. The system currently works and fails over without issues but we're having issues to trying to backup the files. The VM's backup fine with no issues with just about any backup software. The problem is the file share data. Most backup software doesn't support MS clusters or doesn't work with SMB 3.0 or has some other little issue that makes it not work reliably or runs slower than I can deal with. Veeam file copy works but it's so slow. We're getting like 2MB/sec. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my question. What is the proper way to set this up to make backing up easy? Preferably with Veeam. We want to keep one or two copies onsite and one offsite. Spinning up the environment offsite would be great but is not mandatory, maybe something we can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because nearly all backup software is geared towards backing up VM's these days (not the files on the file share), my gut tells me to just create a VM and share the files from the VM. The problem with that is the VM's become huge (3x1.5 TB) and will take forever to migrate and restore. The current VM's are around 50GB and restore or migrate very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on doing a server migration and running into some weird issues that I was hoping I could get some advice on.&amp;nbsp; Here is all the information in regards to the setup, old and new, and what has happened thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old server: Windows server 2012 essentials: Domain controller, file and printer server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Server: Vmware 6.5 running a vm of windows server 2012 r2 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by moving files over. Once that transfer completed, I&amp;nbsp; began by adding the new server to the domain. It was added successfully. I then installed the roles on the new server and after a restart, followed the steps to promote the server to be an AD server. I then proceeded to transfer the 5 fsmo roles, and afterwards running netdom query fsmo showed all the roles assigned to the new server. In the past at this point I've been able to remove the server from the network, update dns, and proceed with the setup. However this is the point where I hit a wall. AD logins stopped responding once the old server was removed, and the new server was not indicating on the network card that it was linked to a domain network, even though the primary dns was pointed at itself. Everything appeared to be working properly from a settings perspective, but other pcs showed the echo %logonserver% as the old server, and attempting to RDP into the new server with domain credentials resulted in an error indicating it could not contact the domain controller. Reconnecting the old server resulted in things working properly again, so to me this seems to indicate the AD transfer didn't complete, even though all signs pointed to it completing. I had to transfer the fsmo roles back and then I attempted again later, still getting the same error. At this point I'm reformatting the new server install and starting over again, but wanted to get any advice on what issue I may be running into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Want to remove the one that doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe we have a corrupt package from the vendor, for Microsoft Office 2016!!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;At my company, we have folder redirection enabled for all users so their desktops, documents, etc are all stored on our file server. Additionally, our users with laptops and Surfaces (all Windows 8.1 or 10) have offline files enabled so their redirected folders are available when they're off-network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the process of replacing our SAN and moving everything over to the new one. For reasons unknown to me, our old "file server" was not a Windows VM, but instead just a share running directly off the old SAN, meaning that just moving a VM or using DFS replication to copy all the data was not a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the weekend I used Robocopy to copy all the data off the old SAN share onto a new Windows 2012 R2 virtual machine. I verified everything copied over, verified all the permissions and ACLs were correct, etc. Then I switched the GPOs for folder redirection and our network share mappings to point to the new server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a precautionary measure, since the GPOs were pointed directly to the old SAN (\\san\shares\users\%username%; \\san\shares\departments\%something%; etc), we disabled the shares on the old SAN, so that clients that didn't update their paths correctly wouldn't be writing to a stale location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked fine for our desktop computers - except for a few minor hiccups, our desktops are all connecting to the new SAN, redirection and shares are working good, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our portable devices though are not cooperating quite as well. We've had a number of them still trying to connect to the old SAN, not getting the updated redirection/share paths, and just staying in a perpetual "offline" mode. To counter this, we tried removing the DNS record for the old SAN and replacing it with a CNAME pointing to the new file server, so that portable devices trying to connect to the old SAN would redirect to the new one and hopefully sync their files, but the Offline Files is still seeming to remain in an offline state, even though pinging the old SAN's name returns the correct IP of the new file server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 2 servers hosted on AWS. Both are running SQL Server Standard 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is on subnet A, 2nd one is on subnet B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet A is: 10.0.7.0/24 and i already assigned some IP including 10.0.7.225, 10.0.7.67&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet B is: 10.0.9.0/24 with some IP assigned: 10.0.9.67, 10.0.9.133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to create Availability Group but got this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the IP addresses configured for the availability group listener can be hosted by the server . Either configure a public cluster network on which one of the specified IP addresses can be hosted, or add another listener IP address which can be hosted on a public cluster network for this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IP i assigned is 10.0.9.100 (cause i replicated from A to B) so it can't conflict with any IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what i was missing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We purchased a number of HP T630 thin client Windows 10 in our office.&amp;nbsp; We are trying to get Spiceworks to recognize them and inventory them.&amp;nbsp; Spiceworks&amp;nbsp;does not even recognize the ip address only as being open.&amp;nbsp; We disabled the firewall, disabled UAC and verified the WMI is running.&amp;nbsp; The thin clients are not part of the domain but we are using the admin account to try to inventory them.&amp;nbsp; Went through several articles but with no success.&amp;nbsp;Has anyone had any success getting HP thin client with Windows 10 to recognize through spiceworks?&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we had a former employee setup our WDS. He didn't leave behind any SOPs and I've never set it up before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is, how do I take my custom VM from VMware and move it over to my WDS as a .wim file? I know that I have to run Sysprep somewhere in the process. Any help would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI, this is for Windows 10 v1709.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to deploy a package today that I've deployed lots of times before.&amp;nbsp; However, today I got an error that says "Conditions not met: No steps were able to run"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I checked the package and it doesn't have any conditions set on it.&amp;nbsp; The properties tab and the step tab are both clear of any conditions so I have no idea what it's referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else ever run into this before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there something out there, either AWS, Google, O365, Excel, or Office add-in (or other software?) that would allow me to do the following? This data is not in a database directly, but it is pulled together from over a dozen non-integrating sources into CSV format. Goal: to have&amp;nbsp;n&amp;nbsp;score card pdfs, or report cards whatever, using each row of data, filling in a score card, and emailing them to each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: taking SSRS and making a different distributed report for each row of data. It's easier to do with data-driven subscriptions in SSRS, but that is not available in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each row of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take each cell in row, fill out a template report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export report into PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email file according to email in one cell in that row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any ideas on how this can be accomplished? I'm stumped.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we are starting to use more and more Windows 10 machines than Windows 7 and starting to notice some policies that aren't carrying over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user logs into a Windows 7 machine, it adds folders to the start menu with shortcuts to specific websites. There are a few folders that have the same URL as other folders. This is intention as we want our users to look up the site by the product name even though some of the products all use the same URL on the back end. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 1&lt;br /&gt;URL 1&lt;br /&gt;Product 2URL 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've noticed in our Windows 10 (1709) machines that it only list duplicate URLs once. Even if the URL shortcuts have different names, it will only show one shortcut to the website instead of the many shortcuts of the same URL with different names.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something? Is this intention and if so, does anyone know a way around this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have some users that are running some very resource intensive processes which often consume many GBs worth of RAM. Often times a user will run a job which ends up consuming close to 100% of the system's RAM (which in our case is around 100GB). The issue in our case, is the disparity between what the user sees reported in Task Manager vs what I (the admin) see reported in Resource Monitor. Task Monitor is reporting that the user's process is using 1.3GB of RAM while Resource Monitor reports the process has 3.7GB committed to memory and 100GB in working memory. Because the user is not able to see this memory issue in Task Manager, they assume the issue is caused by other users on the VM. Without having admin privileges, are there any good ways for a user to view more info on their RAM usage?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I am having an issue installing a local printer on a Windows 7 machine. This is the second time this has happened. I am logged in as a domain admin onto a domain machine with Windows 7 64-bit. When I go to install the printer I receive the error "Printer driver was not installed. Access is denied." Both times this has happened it was a Win 7 machine connecting to a Brother printer. The first time it happened I pounded my head against it for a couple of hours and after restarting the printer it worked. This time no amount of GPO changes, clearing drivers, changing admin accounts, rebooting of laptop or printer will make it work. The laptop can reach the PC I just can't install the drivers and I'm the admin. What am I missing?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I am having an administrative issue at the moment. I have an end user who wants to have FileZilla installed on her PC in order to get some work done with one of her outside clients. The 2&amp;nbsp;SFTP clients I am reviewing at the moment are WinSCP and FIleZilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about the safety of these clients and I want to be certain that all my end users see is what is designated for her to be able to see. I do have the server information in order to pull files but I am concerned that there may be a file there that does not belong there since it is not something on our network and we have no control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is to be able to keep our network secure and to prohibit her from downloading any files that can possibly execute code. We do have Symantec Endpoint protection in place but I am not certain that will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to set out a proactive standard when it comes to this type of client. So basically what I want to do is have whatever may be the safest and most supported client in this environment and to prevent any malicious content from being downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note is when I downloaded FileZilla, Symantec found and quarantined the following file, "marutono.exe"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded FileZilla from the below site&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are an SCCM shop and are growing into the cloud arena. I'm looking at Microsoft's AutoPilot feature. We should have everything we need to proceed... SCCM (yes, I know, optional), Azure Premium, and Intune (another option from what I understand). I'm really looking forward to getting things rolling, but before I do, I'd love to hear from those who are actually using it on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some general questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do home-brewed applications work? What are your most common issues?&lt;br /&gt;Are users trying work arounds?&lt;br /&gt;If so, what kind and what have you done to curb this?&lt;br /&gt;How big are your organizations?&lt;br /&gt;Do you use the whole program, or do you use pieces?&lt;br /&gt;Any other tips or suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;How long have you been using it?&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I've read many an article with all great reviews, but since it's such a new product, I'd love to hear from you that actually use it and what you really think.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of adding a new larger RAID to our server.&amp;nbsp; Set-up is a Dell PE T610 running Server 2008 R2 on the physical machine hosting a 2012 R2 Essentials VM through HyperV.&amp;nbsp; Currently has a PERC H200 card and 4TB RAID10 that I'm replacing with am H710 card and 8TB RAID10.&amp;nbsp; Due to changing controller cards (and purposely not attempting the unsupported foreign config import from the H200 to H710), and wanting to be able to completely revert back to the old setup if things go sideways, my only option is to copy the VM to an external USB drive, disconnect the old RAID, connect the new RAID, copy the VM back to the new RAID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is, HOW to do this exactly.&amp;nbsp; And what is the most reliable and least complicated method.&amp;nbsp; I've been reading everything I can find, but there is precious little info on re-importing a VM to the exact same physical host.&amp;nbsp; I know simply copying the .vhd files to the new RAID and pointing the VM to them does not work.&amp;nbsp; The only other things I've been able to ascertain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; I can re-import the exact same VM to the new location, but FIRST I have to delete the old VM from HYPV manager.&amp;nbsp; I'm not comfortable doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; I can import the VM as a NEW VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm concerned about all of the issues that might crop up with having a new VM.&amp;nbsp; For instanc, I remember reading something about an issue with the virtual network card and MAC address.&amp;nbsp; Will I have to reconnect all of the client computers?&amp;nbsp; Will I have to re-set-up remote web access/remote client access?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm hoping there's away to accomplish option 1 without having to permanently delete the old VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm open to any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we have a two node 2012 R2 Cluster. We are using Starwinds for shared storage. We have 10 VM roles, 1 dhcp server role and 3 Scale out file server Roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal is to provide maximum up time for the VM's and some important file shares.&amp;nbsp; The file share data is actually more important than the VM's. The shares are users, projects and operations.&amp;nbsp; Each share is 1.5 TB max with around 300GB used on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why, but when we originally designed this, Starwinds highly recommended that we create the file shares using the scale out file server role vs using the standard file server role or creating a "VM File server" to share the files.&amp;nbsp; So right now each of the shares is on a SOFS Role and shared to the users from there. From everything I've read this is NOT the way file server user shares should be setup. See&amp;nbsp;when to use a SOFS. The system currently works and fails over without issues but we're having issues to trying to backup the files. The VM's backup fine with no issues with just about any backup software. The problem is the file share data. Most backup software doesn't support MS clusters or doesn't work with SMB 3.0 or has some other little issue that makes it not work reliably or runs slower than I can deal with. Veeam file copy works but it's so slow. We're getting like 2MB/sec. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my question. What is the proper way to set this up to make backing up easy? Preferably with Veeam. We want to keep one or two copies onsite and one offsite. Spinning up the environment offsite would be great but is not mandatory, maybe something we can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because nearly all backup software is geared towards backing up VM's these days (not the files on the file share), my gut tells me to just create a VM and share the files from the VM. The problem with that is the VM's become huge (3x1.5 TB) and will take forever to migrate and restore. The current VM's are around 50GB and restore or migrate very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on doing a server migration and running into some weird issues that I was hoping I could get some advice on.&amp;nbsp; Here is all the information in regards to the setup, old and new, and what has happened thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old server: Windows server 2012 essentials: Domain controller, file and printer server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Server: Vmware 6.5 running a vm of windows server 2012 r2 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by moving files over. Once that transfer completed, I&amp;nbsp; began by adding the new server to the domain. It was added successfully. I then installed the roles on the new server and after a restart, followed the steps to promote the server to be an AD server. I then proceeded to transfer the 5 fsmo roles, and afterwards running netdom query fsmo showed all the roles assigned to the new server. In the past at this point I've been able to remove the server from the network, update dns, and proceed with the setup. However this is the point where I hit a wall. AD logins stopped responding once the old server was removed, and the new server was not indicating on the network card that it was linked to a domain network, even though the primary dns was pointed at itself. Everything appeared to be working properly from a settings perspective, but other pcs showed the echo %logonserver% as the old server, and attempting to RDP into the new server with domain credentials resulted in an error indicating it could not contact the domain controller. Reconnecting the old server resulted in things working properly again, so to me this seems to indicate the AD transfer didn't complete, even though all signs pointed to it completing. I had to transfer the fsmo roles back and then I attempted again later, still getting the same error. At this point I'm reformatting the new server install and starting over again, but wanted to get any advice on what issue I may be running into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;At my company, we have folder redirection enabled for all users so their desktops, documents, etc are all stored on our file server. Additionally, our users with laptops and Surfaces (all Windows 8.1 or 10) have offline files enabled so their redirected folders are available when they're off-network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the process of replacing our SAN and moving everything over to the new one. For reasons unknown to me, our old "file server" was not a Windows VM, but instead just a share running directly off the old SAN, meaning that just moving a VM or using DFS replication to copy all the data was not a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the weekend I used Robocopy to copy all the data off the old SAN share onto a new Windows 2012 R2 virtual machine. I verified everything copied over, verified all the permissions and ACLs were correct, etc. Then I switched the GPOs for folder redirection and our network share mappings to point to the new server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a precautionary measure, since the GPOs were pointed directly to the old SAN (\\san\shares\users\%username%; \\san\shares\departments\%something%; etc), we disabled the shares on the old SAN, so that clients that didn't update their paths correctly wouldn't be writing to a stale location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked fine for our desktop computers - except for a few minor hiccups, our desktops are all connecting to the new SAN, redirection and shares are working good, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our portable devices though are not cooperating quite as well. We've had a number of them still trying to connect to the old SAN, not getting the updated redirection/share paths, and just staying in a perpetual "offline" mode. To counter this, we tried removing the DNS record for the old SAN and replacing it with a CNAME pointing to the new file server, so that portable devices trying to connect to the old SAN would redirect to the new one and hopefully sync their files, but the Offline Files is still seeming to remain in an offline state, even though pinging the old SAN's name returns the correct IP of the new file server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 2 servers hosted on AWS. Both are running SQL Server Standard 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is on subnet A, 2nd one is on subnet B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet A is: 10.0.7.0/24 and i already assigned some IP including 10.0.7.225, 10.0.7.67&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet B is: 10.0.9.0/24 with some IP assigned: 10.0.9.67, 10.0.9.133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to create Availability Group but got this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the IP addresses configured for the availability group listener can be hosted by the server . Either configure a public cluster network on which one of the specified IP addresses can be hosted, or add another listener IP address which can be hosted on a public cluster network for this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IP i assigned is 10.0.9.100 (cause i replicated from A to B) so it can't conflict with any IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what i was missing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to deploy a package today that I've deployed lots of times before.&amp;nbsp; However, today I got an error that says "Conditions not met: No steps were able to run"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I checked the package and it doesn't have any conditions set on it.&amp;nbsp; The properties tab and the step tab are both clear of any conditions so I have no idea what it's referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else ever run into this before?&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there something out there, either AWS, Google, O365, Excel, or Office add-in (or other software?) that would allow me to do the following? This data is not in a database directly, but it is pulled together from over a dozen non-integrating sources into CSV format. Goal: to have&amp;nbsp;n&amp;nbsp;score card pdfs, or report cards whatever, using each row of data, filling in a score card, and emailing them to each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: taking SSRS and making a different distributed report for each row of data. It's easier to do with data-driven subscriptions in SSRS, but that is not available in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each row of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take each cell in row, fill out a template report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export report into PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email file according to email in one cell in that row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any ideas on how this can be accomplished? I'm stumped.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we are starting to use more and more Windows 10 machines than Windows 7 and starting to notice some policies that aren't carrying over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user logs into a Windows 7 machine, it adds folders to the start menu with shortcuts to specific websites. There are a few folders that have the same URL as other folders. This is intention as we want our users to look up the site by the product name even though some of the products all use the same URL on the back end. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 1&lt;br /&gt;URL 1&lt;br /&gt;Product 2URL 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've noticed in our Windows 10 (1709) machines that it only list duplicate URLs once. Even if the URL shortcuts have different names, it will only show one shortcut to the website instead of the many shortcuts of the same URL with different names.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something? Is this intention and if so, does anyone know a way around this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have some users that are running some very resource intensive processes which often consume many GBs worth of RAM. Often times a user will run a job which ends up consuming close to 100% of the system's RAM (which in our case is around 100GB). The issue in our case, is the disparity between what the user sees reported in Task Manager vs what I (the admin) see reported in Resource Monitor. Task Monitor is reporting that the user's process is using 1.3GB of RAM while Resource Monitor reports the process has 3.7GB committed to memory and 100GB in working memory. Because the user is not able to see this memory issue in Task Manager, they assume the issue is caused by other users on the VM. Without having admin privileges, are there any good ways for a user to view more info on their RAM usage?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I am having an issue installing a local printer on a Windows 7 machine. This is the second time this has happened. I am logged in as a domain admin onto a domain machine with Windows 7 64-bit. When I go to install the printer I receive the error "Printer driver was not installed. Access is denied." Both times this has happened it was a Win 7 machine connecting to a Brother printer. The first time it happened I pounded my head against it for a couple of hours and after restarting the printer it worked. This time no amount of GPO changes, clearing drivers, changing admin accounts, rebooting of laptop or printer will make it work. The laptop can reach the PC I just can't install the drivers and I'm the admin. What am I missing?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I am having an administrative issue at the moment. I have an end user who wants to have FileZilla installed on her PC in order to get some work done with one of her outside clients. The 2&amp;nbsp;SFTP clients I am reviewing at the moment are WinSCP and FIleZilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about the safety of these clients and I want to be certain that all my end users see is what is designated for her to be able to see. I do have the server information in order to pull files but I am concerned that there may be a file there that does not belong there since it is not something on our network and we have no control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is to be able to keep our network secure and to prohibit her from downloading any files that can possibly execute code. We do have Symantec Endpoint protection in place but I am not certain that will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to set out a proactive standard when it comes to this type of client. So basically what I want to do is have whatever may be the safest and most supported client in this environment and to prevent any malicious content from being downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note is when I downloaded FileZilla, Symantec found and quarantined the following file, "marutono.exe"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded FileZilla from the below site&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are an SCCM shop and are growing into the cloud arena. I'm looking at Microsoft's AutoPilot feature. We should have everything we need to proceed... SCCM (yes, I know, optional), Azure Premium, and Intune (another option from what I understand). I'm really looking forward to getting things rolling, but before I do, I'd love to hear from those who are actually using it on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some general questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do home-brewed applications work? What are your most common issues?&lt;br /&gt;Are users trying work arounds?&lt;br /&gt;If so, what kind and what have you done to curb this?&lt;br /&gt;How big are your organizations?&lt;br /&gt;Do you use the whole program, or do you use pieces?&lt;br /&gt;Any other tips or suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;How long have you been using it?&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I've read many an article with all great reviews, but since it's such a new product, I'd love to hear from you that actually use it and what you really think.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of adding a new larger RAID to our server.&amp;nbsp; Set-up is a Dell PE T610 running Server 2008 R2 on the physical machine hosting a 2012 R2 Essentials VM through HyperV.&amp;nbsp; Currently has a PERC H200 card and 4TB RAID10 that I'm replacing with am H710 card and 8TB RAID10.&amp;nbsp; Due to changing controller cards (and purposely not attempting the unsupported foreign config import from the H200 to H710), and wanting to be able to completely revert back to the old setup if things go sideways, my only option is to copy the VM to an external USB drive, disconnect the old RAID, connect the new RAID, copy the VM back to the new RAID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is, HOW to do this exactly.&amp;nbsp; And what is the most reliable and least complicated method.&amp;nbsp; I've been reading everything I can find, but there is precious little info on re-importing a VM to the exact same physical host.&amp;nbsp; I know simply copying the .vhd files to the new RAID and pointing the VM to them does not work.&amp;nbsp; The only other things I've been able to ascertain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; I can re-import the exact same VM to the new location, but FIRST I have to delete the old VM from HYPV manager.&amp;nbsp; I'm not comfortable doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; I can import the VM as a NEW VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm concerned about all of the issues that might crop up with having a new VM.&amp;nbsp; For instanc, I remember reading something about an issue with the virtual network card and MAC address.&amp;nbsp; Will I have to reconnect all of the client computers?&amp;nbsp; Will I have to re-set-up remote web access/remote client access?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm hoping there's away to accomplish option 1 without having to permanently delete the old VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm open to any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we have a two node 2012 R2 Cluster. We are using Starwinds for shared storage. We have 10 VM roles, 1 dhcp server role and 3 Scale out file server Roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal is to provide maximum up time for the VM's and some important file shares.&amp;nbsp; The file share data is actually more important than the VM's. The shares are users, projects and operations.&amp;nbsp; Each share is 1.5 TB max with around 300GB used on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why, but when we originally designed this, Starwinds highly recommended that we create the file shares using the scale out file server role vs using the standard file server role or creating a "VM File server" to share the files.&amp;nbsp; So right now each of the shares is on a SOFS Role and shared to the users from there. From everything I've read this is NOT the way file server user shares should be setup. See&amp;nbsp;when to use a SOFS. The system currently works and fails over without issues but we're having issues to trying to backup the files. The VM's backup fine with no issues with just about any backup software. The problem is the file share data. Most backup software doesn't support MS clusters or doesn't work with SMB 3.0 or has some other little issue that makes it not work reliably or runs slower than I can deal with. Veeam file copy works but it's so slow. We're getting like 2MB/sec. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my question. What is the proper way to set this up to make backing up easy? Preferably with Veeam. We want to keep one or two copies onsite and one offsite. Spinning up the environment offsite would be great but is not mandatory, maybe something we can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because nearly all backup software is geared towards backing up VM's these days (not the files on the file share), my gut tells me to just create a VM and share the files from the VM. The problem with that is the VM's become huge (3x1.5 TB) and will take forever to migrate and restore. The current VM's are around 50GB and restore or migrate very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on doing a server migration and running into some weird issues that I was hoping I could get some advice on.&amp;nbsp; Here is all the information in regards to the setup, old and new, and what has happened thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old server: Windows server 2012 essentials: Domain controller, file and printer server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Server: Vmware 6.5 running a vm of windows server 2012 r2 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by moving files over. Once that transfer completed, I&amp;nbsp; began by adding the new server to the domain. It was added successfully. I then installed the roles on the new server and after a restart, followed the steps to promote the server to be an AD server. I then proceeded to transfer the 5 fsmo roles, and afterwards running netdom query fsmo showed all the roles assigned to the new server. In the past at this point I've been able to remove the server from the network, update dns, and proceed with the setup. However this is the point where I hit a wall. AD logins stopped responding once the old server was removed, and the new server was not indicating on the network card that it was linked to a domain network, even though the primary dns was pointed at itself. Everything appeared to be working properly from a settings perspective, but other pcs showed the echo %logonserver% as the old server, and attempting to RDP into the new server with domain credentials resulted in an error indicating it could not contact the domain controller. Reconnecting the old server resulted in things working properly again, so to me this seems to indicate the AD transfer didn't complete, even though all signs pointed to it completing. I had to transfer the fsmo roles back and then I attempted again later, still getting the same error. At this point I'm reformatting the new server install and starting over again, but wanted to get any advice on what issue I may be running into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We have a pc that is showing two menu items, for example Excel 2016. One works and one doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to remove the one that doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe we have a corrupt package from the vendor, for Microsoft Office 2016!!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;At my company, we have folder redirection enabled for all users so their desktops, documents, etc are all stored on our file server. Additionally, our users with laptops and Surfaces (all Windows 8.1 or 10) have offline files enabled so their redirected folders are available when they're off-network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the process of replacing our SAN and moving everything over to the new one. For reasons unknown to me, our old "file server" was not a Windows VM, but instead just a share running directly off the old SAN, meaning that just moving a VM or using DFS replication to copy all the data was not a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the weekend I used Robocopy to copy all the data off the old SAN share onto a new Windows 2012 R2 virtual machine. I verified everything copied over, verified all the permissions and ACLs were correct, etc. Then I switched the GPOs for folder redirection and our network share mappings to point to the new server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a precautionary measure, since the GPOs were pointed directly to the old SAN (\\san\shares\users\%username%; \\san\shares\departments\%something%; etc), we disabled the shares on the old SAN, so that clients that didn't update their paths correctly wouldn't be writing to a stale location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked fine for our desktop computers - except for a few minor hiccups, our desktops are all connecting to the new SAN, redirection and shares are working good, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our portable devices though are not cooperating quite as well. We've had a number of them still trying to connect to the old SAN, not getting the updated redirection/share paths, and just staying in a perpetual "offline" mode. To counter this, we tried removing the DNS record for the old SAN and replacing it with a CNAME pointing to the new file server, so that portable devices trying to connect to the old SAN would redirect to the new one and hopefully sync their files, but the Offline Files is still seeming to remain in an offline state, even though pinging the old SAN's name returns the correct IP of the new file server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 2 servers hosted on AWS. Both are running SQL Server Standard 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is on subnet A, 2nd one is on subnet B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet A is: 10.0.7.0/24 and i already assigned some IP including 10.0.7.225, 10.0.7.67&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet B is: 10.0.9.0/24 with some IP assigned: 10.0.9.67, 10.0.9.133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to create Availability Group but got this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the IP addresses configured for the availability group listener can be hosted by the server . Either configure a public cluster network on which one of the specified IP addresses can be hosted, or add another listener IP address which can be hosted on a public cluster network for this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IP i assigned is 10.0.9.100 (cause i replicated from A to B) so it can't conflict with any IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what i was missing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we had a former employee setup our WDS. He didn't leave behind any SOPs and I've never set it up before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is, how do I take my custom VM from VMware and move it over to my WDS as a .wim file? I know that I have to run Sysprep somewhere in the process. Any help would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI, this is for Windows 10 v1709.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to deploy a package today that I've deployed lots of times before.&amp;nbsp; However, today I got an error that says "Conditions not met: No steps were able to run"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I checked the package and it doesn't have any conditions set on it.&amp;nbsp; The properties tab and the step tab are both clear of any conditions so I have no idea what it's referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else ever run into this before?&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there something out there, either AWS, Google, O365, Excel, or Office add-in (or other software?) that would allow me to do the following? This data is not in a database directly, but it is pulled together from over a dozen non-integrating sources into CSV format. Goal: to have&amp;nbsp;n&amp;nbsp;score card pdfs, or report cards whatever, using each row of data, filling in a score card, and emailing them to each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: taking SSRS and making a different distributed report for each row of data. It's easier to do with data-driven subscriptions in SSRS, but that is not available in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each row of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take each cell in row, fill out a template report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export report into PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email file according to email in one cell in that row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any ideas on how this can be accomplished? I'm stumped.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we are starting to use more and more Windows 10 machines than Windows 7 and starting to notice some policies that aren't carrying over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user logs into a Windows 7 machine, it adds folders to the start menu with shortcuts to specific websites. There are a few folders that have the same URL as other folders. This is intention as we want our users to look up the site by the product name even though some of the products all use the same URL on the back end. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 1&lt;br /&gt;URL 1&lt;br /&gt;Product 2URL 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've noticed in our Windows 10 (1709) machines that it only list duplicate URLs once. Even if the URL shortcuts have different names, it will only show one shortcut to the website instead of the many shortcuts of the same URL with different names.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something? Is this intention and if so, does anyone know a way around this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have some users that are running some very resource intensive processes which often consume many GBs worth of RAM. Often times a user will run a job which ends up consuming close to 100% of the system's RAM (which in our case is around 100GB). The issue in our case, is the disparity between what the user sees reported in Task Manager vs what I (the admin) see reported in Resource Monitor. Task Monitor is reporting that the user's process is using 1.3GB of RAM while Resource Monitor reports the process has 3.7GB committed to memory and 100GB in working memory. Because the user is not able to see this memory issue in Task Manager, they assume the issue is caused by other users on the VM. Without having admin privileges, are there any good ways for a user to view more info on their RAM usage?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I am having an issue installing a local printer on a Windows 7 machine. This is the second time this has happened. I am logged in as a domain admin onto a domain machine with Windows 7 64-bit. When I go to install the printer I receive the error "Printer driver was not installed. Access is denied." Both times this has happened it was a Win 7 machine connecting to a Brother printer. The first time it happened I pounded my head against it for a couple of hours and after restarting the printer it worked. This time no amount of GPO changes, clearing drivers, changing admin accounts, rebooting of laptop or printer will make it work. The laptop can reach the PC I just can't install the drivers and I'm the admin. What am I missing?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I am having an administrative issue at the moment. I have an end user who wants to have FileZilla installed on her PC in order to get some work done with one of her outside clients. The 2&amp;nbsp;SFTP clients I am reviewing at the moment are WinSCP and FIleZilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about the safety of these clients and I want to be certain that all my end users see is what is designated for her to be able to see. I do have the server information in order to pull files but I am concerned that there may be a file there that does not belong there since it is not something on our network and we have no control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is to be able to keep our network secure and to prohibit her from downloading any files that can possibly execute code. We do have Symantec Endpoint protection in place but I am not certain that will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to set out a proactive standard when it comes to this type of client. So basically what I want to do is have whatever may be the safest and most supported client in this environment and to prevent any malicious content from being downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note is when I downloaded FileZilla, Symantec found and quarantined the following file, "marutono.exe"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded FileZilla from the below site&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are an SCCM shop and are growing into the cloud arena. I'm looking at Microsoft's AutoPilot feature. We should have everything we need to proceed... SCCM (yes, I know, optional), Azure Premium, and Intune (another option from what I understand). I'm really looking forward to getting things rolling, but before I do, I'd love to hear from those who are actually using it on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some general questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do home-brewed applications work? What are your most common issues?&lt;br /&gt;Are users trying work arounds?&lt;br /&gt;If so, what kind and what have you done to curb this?&lt;br /&gt;How big are your organizations?&lt;br /&gt;Do you use the whole program, or do you use pieces?&lt;br /&gt;Any other tips or suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;How long have you been using it?&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I've read many an article with all great reviews, but since it's such a new product, I'd love to hear from you that actually use it and what you really think.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of adding a new larger RAID to our server.&amp;nbsp; Set-up is a Dell PE T610 running Server 2008 R2 on the physical machine hosting a 2012 R2 Essentials VM through HyperV.&amp;nbsp; Currently has a PERC H200 card and 4TB RAID10 that I'm replacing with am H710 card and 8TB RAID10.&amp;nbsp; Due to changing controller cards (and purposely not attempting the unsupported foreign config import from the H200 to H710), and wanting to be able to completely revert back to the old setup if things go sideways, my only option is to copy the VM to an external USB drive, disconnect the old RAID, connect the new RAID, copy the VM back to the new RAID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is, HOW to do this exactly.&amp;nbsp; And what is the most reliable and least complicated method.&amp;nbsp; I've been reading everything I can find, but there is precious little info on re-importing a VM to the exact same physical host.&amp;nbsp; I know simply copying the .vhd files to the new RAID and pointing the VM to them does not work.&amp;nbsp; The only other things I've been able to ascertain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; I can re-import the exact same VM to the new location, but FIRST I have to delete the old VM from HYPV manager.&amp;nbsp; I'm not comfortable doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; I can import the VM as a NEW VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm concerned about all of the issues that might crop up with having a new VM.&amp;nbsp; For instanc, I remember reading something about an issue with the virtual network card and MAC address.&amp;nbsp; Will I have to reconnect all of the client computers?&amp;nbsp; Will I have to re-set-up remote web access/remote client access?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm hoping there's away to accomplish option 1 without having to permanently delete the old VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm open to any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we have a two node 2012 R2 Cluster. We are using Starwinds for shared storage. We have 10 VM roles, 1 dhcp server role and 3 Scale out file server Roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal is to provide maximum up time for the VM's and some important file shares.&amp;nbsp; The file share data is actually more important than the VM's. The shares are users, projects and operations.&amp;nbsp; Each share is 1.5 TB max with around 300GB used on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why, but when we originally designed this, Starwinds highly recommended that we create the file shares using the scale out file server role vs using the standard file server role or creating a "VM File server" to share the files.&amp;nbsp; So right now each of the shares is on a SOFS Role and shared to the users from there. From everything I've read this is NOT the way file server user shares should be setup. See&amp;nbsp;when to use a SOFS. The system currently works and fails over without issues but we're having issues to trying to backup the files. The VM's backup fine with no issues with just about any backup software. The problem is the file share data. Most backup software doesn't support MS clusters or doesn't work with SMB 3.0 or has some other little issue that makes it not work reliably or runs slower than I can deal with. Veeam file copy works but it's so slow. We're getting like 2MB/sec. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my question. What is the proper way to set this up to make backing up easy? Preferably with Veeam. We want to keep one or two copies onsite and one offsite. Spinning up the environment offsite would be great but is not mandatory, maybe something we can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because nearly all backup software is geared towards backing up VM's these days (not the files on the file share), my gut tells me to just create a VM and share the files from the VM. The problem with that is the VM's become huge (3x1.5 TB) and will take forever to migrate and restore. The current VM's are around 50GB and restore or migrate very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on doing a server migration and running into some weird issues that I was hoping I could get some advice on.&amp;nbsp; Here is all the information in regards to the setup, old and new, and what has happened thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old server: Windows server 2012 essentials: Domain controller, file and printer server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Server: Vmware 6.5 running a vm of windows server 2012 r2 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by moving files over. Once that transfer completed, I&amp;nbsp; began by adding the new server to the domain. It was added successfully. I then installed the roles on the new server and after a restart, followed the steps to promote the server to be an AD server. I then proceeded to transfer the 5 fsmo roles, and afterwards running netdom query fsmo showed all the roles assigned to the new server. In the past at this point I've been able to remove the server from the network, update dns, and proceed with the setup. However this is the point where I hit a wall. AD logins stopped responding once the old server was removed, and the new server was not indicating on the network card that it was linked to a domain network, even though the primary dns was pointed at itself. Everything appeared to be working properly from a settings perspective, but other pcs showed the echo %logonserver% as the old server, and attempting to RDP into the new server with domain credentials resulted in an error indicating it could not contact the domain controller. Reconnecting the old server resulted in things working properly again, so to me this seems to indicate the AD transfer didn't complete, even though all signs pointed to it completing. I had to transfer the fsmo roles back and then I attempted again later, still getting the same error. At this point I'm reformatting the new server install and starting over again, but wanted to get any advice on what issue I may be running into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;At my company, we have folder redirection enabled for all users so their desktops, documents, etc are all stored on our file server. Additionally, our users with laptops and Surfaces (all Windows 8.1 or 10) have offline files enabled so their redirected folders are available when they're off-network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the process of replacing our SAN and moving everything over to the new one. For reasons unknown to me, our old "file server" was not a Windows VM, but instead just a share running directly off the old SAN, meaning that just moving a VM or using DFS replication to copy all the data was not a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the weekend I used Robocopy to copy all the data off the old SAN share onto a new Windows 2012 R2 virtual machine. I verified everything copied over, verified all the permissions and ACLs were correct, etc. Then I switched the GPOs for folder redirection and our network share mappings to point to the new server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a precautionary measure, since the GPOs were pointed directly to the old SAN (\\san\shares\users\%username%; \\san\shares\departments\%something%; etc), we disabled the shares on the old SAN, so that clients that didn't update their paths correctly wouldn't be writing to a stale location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked fine for our desktop computers - except for a few minor hiccups, our desktops are all connecting to the new SAN, redirection and shares are working good, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our portable devices though are not cooperating quite as well. We've had a number of them still trying to connect to the old SAN, not getting the updated redirection/share paths, and just staying in a perpetual "offline" mode. To counter this, we tried removing the DNS record for the old SAN and replacing it with a CNAME pointing to the new file server, so that portable devices trying to connect to the old SAN would redirect to the new one and hopefully sync their files, but the Offline Files is still seeming to remain in an offline state, even though pinging the old SAN's name returns the correct IP of the new file server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Either configure a public cluster network on which one of the specified IP addresses can be hosted, or add another listener IP address which can be hosted on a public cluster network for this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IP i assigned is 10.0.9.100 (cause i replicated from A to B) so it can't conflict with any IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what i was missing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We purchased a number of HP T630 thin client Windows 10 in our office.&amp;nbsp; We are trying to get Spiceworks to recognize them and inventory them.&amp;nbsp; Spiceworks&amp;nbsp;does not even recognize the ip address only as being open.&amp;nbsp; We disabled the firewall, disabled UAC and verified the WMI is running.&amp;nbsp; The thin clients are not part of the domain but we are using the admin account to try to inventory them.&amp;nbsp; Went through several articles but with no success.&amp;nbsp;Has anyone had any success getting HP thin client with Windows 10 to recognize through spiceworks?&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we had a former employee setup our WDS. He didn't leave behind any SOPs and I've never set it up before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is, how do I take my custom VM from VMware and move it over to my WDS as a .wim file? I know that I have to run Sysprep somewhere in the process. Any help would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI, this is for Windows 10 v1709.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to deploy a package today that I've deployed lots of times before.&amp;nbsp; However, today I got an error that says "Conditions not met: No steps were able to run"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I checked the package and it doesn't have any conditions set on it.&amp;nbsp; The properties tab and the step tab are both clear of any conditions so I have no idea what it's referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else ever run into this before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found on Spiceworks: https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2162378-pdq-deploy-conditinos-not-met-no-steps-were-able-to-run?utm_source=copy_paste&amp;amp;utm_campaign=growth&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there something out there, either AWS, Google, O365, Excel, or Office add-in (or other software?) that would allow me to do the following? This data is not in a database directly, but it is pulled together from over a dozen non-integrating sources into CSV format. Goal: to have&amp;nbsp;n&amp;nbsp;score card pdfs, or report cards whatever, using each row of data, filling in a score card, and emailing them to each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: taking SSRS and making a different distributed report for each row of data. It's easier to do with data-driven subscriptions in SSRS, but that is not available in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each row of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take each cell in row, fill out a template report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export report into PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email file according to email in one cell in that row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any ideas on how this can be accomplished? I'm stumped.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we are starting to use more and more Windows 10 machines than Windows 7 and starting to notice some policies that aren't carrying over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user logs into a Windows 7 machine, it adds folders to the start menu with shortcuts to specific websites. There are a few folders that have the same URL as other folders. This is intention as we want our users to look up the site by the product name even though some of the products all use the same URL on the back end. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 1&lt;br /&gt;URL 1&lt;br /&gt;Product 2URL 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've noticed in our Windows 10 (1709) machines that it only list duplicate URLs once. Even if the URL shortcuts have different names, it will only show one shortcut to the website instead of the many shortcuts of the same URL with different names.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something? Is this intention and if so, does anyone know a way around this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have some users that are running some very resource intensive processes which often consume many GBs worth of RAM. Often times a user will run a job which ends up consuming close to 100% of the system's RAM (which in our case is around 100GB). The issue in our case, is the disparity between what the user sees reported in Task Manager vs what I (the admin) see reported in Resource Monitor. Task Monitor is reporting that the user's process is using 1.3GB of RAM while Resource Monitor reports the process has 3.7GB committed to memory and 100GB in working memory. Because the user is not able to see this memory issue in Task Manager, they assume the issue is caused by other users on the VM. Without having admin privileges, are there any good ways for a user to view more info on their RAM usage?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I am having an issue installing a local printer on a Windows 7 machine. This is the second time this has happened. I am logged in as a domain admin onto a domain machine with Windows 7 64-bit. When I go to install the printer I receive the error "Printer driver was not installed. Access is denied." Both times this has happened it was a Win 7 machine connecting to a Brother printer. The first time it happened I pounded my head against it for a couple of hours and after restarting the printer it worked. This time no amount of GPO changes, clearing drivers, changing admin accounts, rebooting of laptop or printer will make it work. The laptop can reach the PC I just can't install the drivers and I'm the admin. What am I missing?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I am having an administrative issue at the moment. I have an end user who wants to have FileZilla installed on her PC in order to get some work done with one of her outside clients. The 2&amp;nbsp;SFTP clients I am reviewing at the moment are WinSCP and FIleZilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about the safety of these clients and I want to be certain that all my end users see is what is designated for her to be able to see. I do have the server information in order to pull files but I am concerned that there may be a file there that does not belong there since it is not something on our network and we have no control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is to be able to keep our network secure and to prohibit her from downloading any files that can possibly execute code. We do have Symantec Endpoint protection in place but I am not certain that will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to set out a proactive standard when it comes to this type of client. So basically what I want to do is have whatever may be the safest and most supported client in this environment and to prevent any malicious content from being downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note is when I downloaded FileZilla, Symantec found and quarantined the following file, "marutono.exe"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded FileZilla from the below site&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are an SCCM shop and are growing into the cloud arena. I'm looking at Microsoft's AutoPilot feature. We should have everything we need to proceed... SCCM (yes, I know, optional), Azure Premium, and Intune (another option from what I understand). I'm really looking forward to getting things rolling, but before I do, I'd love to hear from those who are actually using it on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some general questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do home-brewed applications work? What are your most common issues?&lt;br /&gt;Are users trying work arounds?&lt;br /&gt;If so, what kind and what have you done to curb this?&lt;br /&gt;How big are your organizations?&lt;br /&gt;Do you use the whole program, or do you use pieces?&lt;br /&gt;Any other tips or suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;How long have you been using it?&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I've read many an article with all great reviews, but since it's such a new product, I'd love to hear from you that actually use it and what you really think.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of adding a new larger RAID to our server.&amp;nbsp; Set-up is a Dell PE T610 running Server 2008 R2 on the physical machine hosting a 2012 R2 Essentials VM through HyperV.&amp;nbsp; Currently has a PERC H200 card and 4TB RAID10 that I'm replacing with am H710 card and 8TB RAID10.&amp;nbsp; Due to changing controller cards (and purposely not attempting the unsupported foreign config import from the H200 to H710), and wanting to be able to completely revert back to the old setup if things go sideways, my only option is to copy the VM to an external USB drive, disconnect the old RAID, connect the new RAID, copy the VM back to the new RAID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is, HOW to do this exactly.&amp;nbsp; And what is the most reliable and least complicated method.&amp;nbsp; I've been reading everything I can find, but there is precious little info on re-importing a VM to the exact same physical host.&amp;nbsp; I know simply copying the .vhd files to the new RAID and pointing the VM to them does not work.&amp;nbsp; The only other things I've been able to ascertain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; I can re-import the exact same VM to the new location, but FIRST I have to delete the old VM from HYPV manager.&amp;nbsp; I'm not comfortable doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; I can import the VM as a NEW VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm concerned about all of the issues that might crop up with having a new VM.&amp;nbsp; For instanc, I remember reading something about an issue with the virtual network card and MAC address.&amp;nbsp; Will I have to reconnect all of the client computers?&amp;nbsp; Will I have to re-set-up remote web access/remote client access?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm hoping there's away to accomplish option 1 without having to permanently delete the old VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm open to any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we have a two node 2012 R2 Cluster. We are using Starwinds for shared storage. We have 10 VM roles, 1 dhcp server role and 3 Scale out file server Roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal is to provide maximum up time for the VM's and some important file shares.&amp;nbsp; The file share data is actually more important than the VM's. The shares are users, projects and operations.&amp;nbsp; Each share is 1.5 TB max with around 300GB used on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why, but when we originally designed this, Starwinds highly recommended that we create the file shares using the scale out file server role vs using the standard file server role or creating a "VM File server" to share the files.&amp;nbsp; So right now each of the shares is on a SOFS Role and shared to the users from there. From everything I've read this is NOT the way file server user shares should be setup. See&amp;nbsp;when to use a SOFS. The system currently works and fails over without issues but we're having issues to trying to backup the files. The VM's backup fine with no issues with just about any backup software. The problem is the file share data. Most backup software doesn't support MS clusters or doesn't work with SMB 3.0 or has some other little issue that makes it not work reliably or runs slower than I can deal with. Veeam file copy works but it's so slow. We're getting like 2MB/sec. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my question. What is the proper way to set this up to make backing up easy? Preferably with Veeam. We want to keep one or two copies onsite and one offsite. Spinning up the environment offsite would be great but is not mandatory, maybe something we can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because nearly all backup software is geared towards backing up VM's these days (not the files on the file share), my gut tells me to just create a VM and share the files from the VM. The problem with that is the VM's become huge (3x1.5 TB) and will take forever to migrate and restore. The current VM's are around 50GB and restore or migrate very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on doing a server migration and running into some weird issues that I was hoping I could get some advice on.&amp;nbsp; Here is all the information in regards to the setup, old and new, and what has happened thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old server: Windows server 2012 essentials: Domain controller, file and printer server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Server: Vmware 6.5 running a vm of windows server 2012 r2 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by moving files over. Once that transfer completed, I&amp;nbsp; began by adding the new server to the domain. It was added successfully. I then installed the roles on the new server and after a restart, followed the steps to promote the server to be an AD server. I then proceeded to transfer the 5 fsmo roles, and afterwards running netdom query fsmo showed all the roles assigned to the new server. In the past at this point I've been able to remove the server from the network, update dns, and proceed with the setup. However this is the point where I hit a wall. AD logins stopped responding once the old server was removed, and the new server was not indicating on the network card that it was linked to a domain network, even though the primary dns was pointed at itself. Everything appeared to be working properly from a settings perspective, but other pcs showed the echo %logonserver% as the old server, and attempting to RDP into the new server with domain credentials resulted in an error indicating it could not contact the domain controller. Reconnecting the old server resulted in things working properly again, so to me this seems to indicate the AD transfer didn't complete, even though all signs pointed to it completing. I had to transfer the fsmo roles back and then I attempted again later, still getting the same error. At this point I'm reformatting the new server install and starting over again, but wanted to get any advice on what issue I may be running into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We have a pc that is showing two menu items, for example Excel 2016. One works and one doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to remove the one that doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe we have a corrupt package from the vendor, for Microsoft Office 2016!!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;At my company, we have folder redirection enabled for all users so their desktops, documents, etc are all stored on our file server. Additionally, our users with laptops and Surfaces (all Windows 8.1 or 10) have offline files enabled so their redirected folders are available when they're off-network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the process of replacing our SAN and moving everything over to the new one. For reasons unknown to me, our old "file server" was not a Windows VM, but instead just a share running directly off the old SAN, meaning that just moving a VM or using DFS replication to copy all the data was not a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the weekend I used Robocopy to copy all the data off the old SAN share onto a new Windows 2012 R2 virtual machine. I verified everything copied over, verified all the permissions and ACLs were correct, etc. Then I switched the GPOs for folder redirection and our network share mappings to point to the new server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a precautionary measure, since the GPOs were pointed directly to the old SAN (\\san\shares\users\%username%; \\san\shares\departments\%something%; etc), we disabled the shares on the old SAN, so that clients that didn't update their paths correctly wouldn't be writing to a stale location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked fine for our desktop computers - except for a few minor hiccups, our desktops are all connecting to the new SAN, redirection and shares are working good, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our portable devices though are not cooperating quite as well. We've had a number of them still trying to connect to the old SAN, not getting the updated redirection/share paths, and just staying in a perpetual "offline" mode. To counter this, we tried removing the DNS record for the old SAN and replacing it with a CNAME pointing to the new file server, so that portable devices trying to connect to the old SAN would redirect to the new one and hopefully sync their files, but the Offline Files is still seeming to remain in an offline state, even though pinging the old SAN's name returns the correct IP of the new file server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 2 servers hosted on AWS. Both are running SQL Server Standard 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is on subnet A, 2nd one is on subnet B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet A is: 10.0.7.0/24 and i already assigned some IP including 10.0.7.225, 10.0.7.67&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet B is: 10.0.9.0/24 with some IP assigned: 10.0.9.67, 10.0.9.133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to create Availability Group but got this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the IP addresses configured for the availability group listener can be hosted by the server . Either configure a public cluster network on which one of the specified IP addresses can be hosted, or add another listener IP address which can be hosted on a public cluster network for this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IP i assigned is 10.0.9.100 (cause i replicated from A to B) so it can't conflict with any IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what i was missing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we had a former employee setup our WDS. He didn't leave behind any SOPs and I've never set it up before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is, how do I take my custom VM from VMware and move it over to my WDS as a .wim file? I know that I have to run Sysprep somewhere in the process. Any help would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI, this is for Windows 10 v1709.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to deploy a package today that I've deployed lots of times before.&amp;nbsp; However, today I got an error that says "Conditions not met: No steps were able to run"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I checked the package and it doesn't have any conditions set on it.&amp;nbsp; The properties tab and the step tab are both clear of any conditions so I have no idea what it's referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else ever run into this before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there something out there, either AWS, Google, O365, Excel, or Office add-in (or other software?) that would allow me to do the following? This data is not in a database directly, but it is pulled together from over a dozen non-integrating sources into CSV format. Goal: to have&amp;nbsp;n&amp;nbsp;score card pdfs, or report cards whatever, using each row of data, filling in a score card, and emailing them to each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: taking SSRS and making a different distributed report for each row of data. It's easier to do with data-driven subscriptions in SSRS, but that is not available in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each row of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take each cell in row, fill out a template report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export report into PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email file according to email in one cell in that row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any ideas on how this can be accomplished? I'm stumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the same WLAN NIC work on a different system without issue? If so, check the driver and driver version for the wireless NIC on the working and non-working system. If it doesn't work on a different system or any others, then it's an issue with the WLAN NIC - likely software configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If static IP doesn't allow you to ping the default GW over wireless but the system appears to be connected to the wireless network, check the event logs on the Windows host to see if there is any more details there. Also ensure the WLAN NIC is compatible with whatever wireless you are broadcasting (ie: if broadcasting 802.11g, ensure the WLAN NIC supports 802.11g).&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we are starting to use more and more Windows 10 machines than Windows 7 and starting to notice some policies that aren't carrying over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user logs into a Windows 7 machine, it adds folders to the start menu with shortcuts to specific websites. There are a few folders that have the same URL as other folders. This is intention as we want our users to look up the site by the product name even though some of the products all use the same URL on the back end. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 1&lt;br /&gt;URL 1&lt;br /&gt;Product 2URL 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've noticed in our Windows 10 (1709) machines that it only list duplicate URLs once. Even if the URL shortcuts have different names, it will only show one shortcut to the website instead of the many shortcuts of the same URL with different names.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something? Is this intention and if so, does anyone know a way around this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have some users that are running some very resource intensive processes which often consume many GBs worth of RAM. Often times a user will run a job which ends up consuming close to 100% of the system's RAM (which in our case is around 100GB). The issue in our case, is the disparity between what the user sees reported in Task Manager vs what I (the admin) see reported in Resource Monitor. Task Monitor is reporting that the user's process is using 1.3GB of RAM while Resource Monitor reports the process has 3.7GB committed to memory and 100GB in working memory. Because the user is not able to see this memory issue in Task Manager, they assume the issue is caused by other users on the VM. Without having admin privileges, are there any good ways for a user to view more info on their RAM usage?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I am having an issue installing a local printer on a Windows 7 machine. This is the second time this has happened. I am logged in as a domain admin onto a domain machine with Windows 7 64-bit. When I go to install the printer I receive the error "Printer driver was not installed. Access is denied." Both times this has happened it was a Win 7 machine connecting to a Brother printer. The first time it happened I pounded my head against it for a couple of hours and after restarting the printer it worked. This time no amount of GPO changes, clearing drivers, changing admin accounts, rebooting of laptop or printer will make it work. The laptop can reach the PC I just can't install the drivers and I'm the admin. What am I missing?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I am having an administrative issue at the moment. I have an end user who wants to have FileZilla installed on her PC in order to get some work done with one of her outside clients. The 2&amp;nbsp;SFTP clients I am reviewing at the moment are WinSCP and FIleZilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about the safety of these clients and I want to be certain that all my end users see is what is designated for her to be able to see. I do have the server information in order to pull files but I am concerned that there may be a file there that does not belong there since it is not something on our network and we have no control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is to be able to keep our network secure and to prohibit her from downloading any files that can possibly execute code. We do have Symantec Endpoint protection in place but I am not certain that will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to set out a proactive standard when it comes to this type of client. So basically what I want to do is have whatever may be the safest and most supported client in this environment and to prevent any malicious content from being downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note is when I downloaded FileZilla, Symantec found and quarantined the following file, "marutono.exe"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded FileZilla from the below site&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I just created a 16 GB bootable custom Windows 10 image. I cannot use a USB drive. I also do not have SCCM at my disposal. I need to know if there is a way to split the .iso file into two so that I can burn them to 8.5 GB DVDs. Is there any way to accomplish this? Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are an SCCM shop and are growing into the cloud arena. I'm looking at Microsoft's AutoPilot feature. We should have everything we need to proceed... SCCM (yes, I know, optional), Azure Premium, and Intune (another option from what I understand). I'm really looking forward to getting things rolling, but before I do, I'd love to hear from those who are actually using it on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some general questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do home-brewed applications work? What are your most common issues?&lt;br /&gt;Are users trying work arounds?&lt;br /&gt;If so, what kind and what have you done to curb this?&lt;br /&gt;How big are your organizations?&lt;br /&gt;Do you use the whole program, or do you use pieces?&lt;br /&gt;Any other tips or suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;How long have you been using it?&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I've read many an article with all great reviews, but since it's such a new product, I'd love to hear from you that actually use it and what you really think.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of adding a new larger RAID to our server.&amp;nbsp; Set-up is a Dell PE T610 running Server 2008 R2 on the physical machine hosting a 2012 R2 Essentials VM through HyperV.&amp;nbsp; Currently has a PERC H200 card and 4TB RAID10 that I'm replacing with am H710 card and 8TB RAID10.&amp;nbsp; Due to changing controller cards (and purposely not attempting the unsupported foreign config import from the H200 to H710), and wanting to be able to completely revert back to the old setup if things go sideways, my only option is to copy the VM to an external USB drive, disconnect the old RAID, connect the new RAID, copy the VM back to the new RAID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is, HOW to do this exactly.&amp;nbsp; And what is the most reliable and least complicated method.&amp;nbsp; I've been reading everything I can find, but there is precious little info on re-importing a VM to the exact same physical host.&amp;nbsp; I know simply copying the .vhd files to the new RAID and pointing the VM to them does not work.&amp;nbsp; The only other things I've been able to ascertain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; I can re-import the exact same VM to the new location, but FIRST I have to delete the old VM from HYPV manager.&amp;nbsp; I'm not comfortable doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; I can import the VM as a NEW VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm concerned about all of the issues that might crop up with having a new VM.&amp;nbsp; For instanc, I remember reading something about an issue with the virtual network card and MAC address.&amp;nbsp; Will I have to reconnect all of the client computers?&amp;nbsp; Will I have to re-set-up remote web access/remote client access?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm hoping there's away to accomplish option 1 without having to permanently delete the old VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm open to any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we have a two node 2012 R2 Cluster. We are using Starwinds for shared storage. We have 10 VM roles, 1 dhcp server role and 3 Scale out file server Roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal is to provide maximum up time for the VM's and some important file shares.&amp;nbsp; The file share data is actually more important than the VM's. The shares are users, projects and operations.&amp;nbsp; Each share is 1.5 TB max with around 300GB used on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why, but when we originally designed this, Starwinds highly recommended that we create the file shares using the scale out file server role vs using the standard file server role or creating a "VM File server" to share the files.&amp;nbsp; So right now each of the shares is on a SOFS Role and shared to the users from there. From everything I've read this is NOT the way file server user shares should be setup. See&amp;nbsp;when to use a SOFS. The system currently works and fails over without issues but we're having issues to trying to backup the files. The VM's backup fine with no issues with just about any backup software. The problem is the file share data. Most backup software doesn't support MS clusters or doesn't work with SMB 3.0 or has some other little issue that makes it not work reliably or runs slower than I can deal with. Veeam file copy works but it's so slow. We're getting like 2MB/sec. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my question. What is the proper way to set this up to make backing up easy? Preferably with Veeam. We want to keep one or two copies onsite and one offsite. Spinning up the environment offsite would be great but is not mandatory, maybe something we can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because nearly all backup software is geared towards backing up VM's these days (not the files on the file share), my gut tells me to just create a VM and share the files from the VM. The problem with that is the VM's become huge (3x1.5 TB) and will take forever to migrate and restore. The current VM's are around 50GB and restore or migrate very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Does the same WLAN NIC work on a different system without issue? If so, check the driver and driver version for the wireless NIC on the working and non-working system. If it doesn't work on a different system or any others, then it's an issue with the WLAN NIC - likely software configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If static IP doesn't allow you to ping the default GW over wireless but the system appears to be connected to the wireless network, check the event logs on the Windows host to see if there is any more details there. Also ensure the WLAN NIC is compatible with whatever wireless you are broadcasting (ie: if broadcasting 802.11g, ensure the WLAN NIC supports 802.11g).&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on doing a server migration and running into some weird issues that I was hoping I could get some advice on.&amp;nbsp; Here is all the information in regards to the setup, old and new, and what has happened thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old server: Windows server 2012 essentials: Domain controller, file and printer server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Server: Vmware 6.5 running a vm of windows server 2012 r2 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by moving files over. Once that transfer completed, I&amp;nbsp; began by adding the new server to the domain. It was added successfully. I then installed the roles on the new server and after a restart, followed the steps to promote the server to be an AD server. I then proceeded to transfer the 5 fsmo roles, and afterwards running netdom query fsmo showed all the roles assigned to the new server. In the past at this point I've been able to remove the server from the network, update dns, and proceed with the setup. However this is the point where I hit a wall. AD logins stopped responding once the old server was removed, and the new server was not indicating on the network card that it was linked to a domain network, even though the primary dns was pointed at itself. Everything appeared to be working properly from a settings perspective, but other pcs showed the echo %logonserver% as the old server, and attempting to RDP into the new server with domain credentials resulted in an error indicating it could not contact the domain controller. Reconnecting the old server resulted in things working properly again, so to me this seems to indicate the AD transfer didn't complete, even though all signs pointed to it completing. I had to transfer the fsmo roles back and then I attempted again later, still getting the same error. At this point I'm reformatting the new server install and starting over again, but wanted to get any advice on what issue I may be running into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We have a pc that is showing two menu items, for example Excel 2016. One works and one doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to remove the one that doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;At my company, we have folder redirection enabled for all users so their desktops, documents, etc are all stored on our file server. Additionally, our users with laptops and Surfaces (all Windows 8.1 or 10) have offline files enabled so their redirected folders are available when they're off-network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the process of replacing our SAN and moving everything over to the new one. For reasons unknown to me, our old "file server" was not a Windows VM, but instead just a share running directly off the old SAN, meaning that just moving a VM or using DFS replication to copy all the data was not a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the weekend I used Robocopy to copy all the data off the old SAN share onto a new Windows 2012 R2 virtual machine. I verified everything copied over, verified all the permissions and ACLs were correct, etc. Then I switched the GPOs for folder redirection and our network share mappings to point to the new server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a precautionary measure, since the GPOs were pointed directly to the old SAN (\\san\shares\users\%username%; \\san\shares\departments\%something%; etc), we disabled the shares on the old SAN, so that clients that didn't update their paths correctly wouldn't be writing to a stale location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked fine for our desktop computers - except for a few minor hiccups, our desktops are all connecting to the new SAN, redirection and shares are working good, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our portable devices though are not cooperating quite as well. We've had a number of them still trying to connect to the old SAN, not getting the updated redirection/share paths, and just staying in a perpetual "offline" mode. To counter this, we tried removing the DNS record for the old SAN and replacing it with a CNAME pointing to the new file server, so that portable devices trying to connect to the old SAN would redirect to the new one and hopefully sync their files, but the Offline Files is still seeming to remain in an offline state, even though pinging the old SAN's name returns the correct IP of the new file server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 2 servers hosted on AWS. Both are running SQL Server Standard 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is on subnet A, 2nd one is on subnet B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet A is: 10.0.7.0/24 and i already assigned some IP including 10.0.7.225, 10.0.7.67&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet B is: 10.0.9.0/24 with some IP assigned: 10.0.9.67, 10.0.9.133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to create Availability Group but got this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the IP addresses configured for the availability group listener can be hosted by the server . Either configure a public cluster network on which one of the specified IP addresses can be hosted, or add another listener IP address which can be hosted on a public cluster network for this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IP i assigned is 10.0.9.100 (cause i replicated from A to B) so it can't conflict with any IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what i was missing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I tried to deploy a package today that I've deployed lots of times before.&amp;nbsp; However, today I got an error that says "Conditions not met: No steps were able to run"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I checked the package and it doesn't have any conditions set on it.&amp;nbsp; The properties tab and the step tab are both clear of any conditions so I have no idea what it's referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else ever run into this before?&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there something out there, either AWS, Google, O365, Excel, or Office add-in (or other software?) that would allow me to do the following? This data is not in a database directly, but it is pulled together from over a dozen non-integrating sources into CSV format. Goal: to have&amp;nbsp;n&amp;nbsp;score card pdfs, or report cards whatever, using each row of data, filling in a score card, and emailing them to each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: taking SSRS and making a different distributed report for each row of data. It's easier to do with data-driven subscriptions in SSRS, but that is not available in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each row of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take each cell in row, fill out a template report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export report into PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email file according to email in one cell in that row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any ideas on how this can be accomplished? I'm stumped.&lt;/p&gt;

Also ensure the WLAN NIC is compatible with whatever wireless you are broadcasting (ie: if broadcasting 802.11g, ensure the WLAN NIC supports 802.11g).&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we are starting to use more and more Windows 10 machines than Windows 7 and starting to notice some policies that aren't carrying over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user logs into a Windows 7 machine, it adds folders to the start menu with shortcuts to specific websites. There are a few folders that have the same URL as other folders. This is intention as we want our users to look up the site by the product name even though some of the products all use the same URL on the back end. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product 1&lt;br /&gt;URL 1&lt;br /&gt;Product 2URL 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've noticed in our Windows 10 (1709) machines that it only list duplicate URLs once. Even if the URL shortcuts have different names, it will only show one shortcut to the website instead of the many shortcuts of the same URL with different names.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something? Is this intention and if so, does anyone know a way around this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I have some users that are running some very resource intensive processes which often consume many GBs worth of RAM. Often times a user will run a job which ends up consuming close to 100% of the system's RAM (which in our case is around 100GB). The issue in our case, is the disparity between what the user sees reported in Task Manager vs what I (the admin) see reported in Resource Monitor. Task Monitor is reporting that the user's process is using 1.3GB of RAM while Resource Monitor reports the process has 3.7GB committed to memory and 100GB in working memory. Because the user is not able to see this memory issue in Task Manager, they assume the issue is caused by other users on the VM. Without having admin privileges, are there any good ways for a user to view more info on their RAM usage?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I am having an issue installing a local printer on a Windows 7 machine. This is the second time this has happened. I am logged in as a domain admin onto a domain machine with Windows 7 64-bit. When I go to install the printer I receive the error "Printer driver was not installed. Access is denied." Both times this has happened it was a Win 7 machine connecting to a Brother printer. The first time it happened I pounded my head against it for a couple of hours and after restarting the printer it worked. This time no amount of GPO changes, clearing drivers, changing admin accounts, rebooting of laptop or printer will make it work. The laptop can reach the PC I just can't install the drivers and I'm the admin. What am I missing?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I am having an administrative issue at the moment. I have an end user who wants to have FileZilla installed on her PC in order to get some work done with one of her outside clients. The 2&amp;nbsp;SFTP clients I am reviewing at the moment are WinSCP and FIleZilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about the safety of these clients and I want to be certain that all my end users see is what is designated for her to be able to see. I do have the server information in order to pull files but I am concerned that there may be a file there that does not belong there since it is not something on our network and we have no control over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want is to be able to keep our network secure and to prohibit her from downloading any files that can possibly execute code. We do have Symantec Endpoint protection in place but I am not certain that will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to set out a proactive standard when it comes to this type of client. So basically what I want to do is have whatever may be the safest and most supported client in this environment and to prevent any malicious content from being downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other note is when I downloaded FileZilla, Symantec found and quarantined the following file, "marutono.exe"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded FileZilla from the below site&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We are an SCCM shop and are growing into the cloud arena. I'm looking at Microsoft's AutoPilot feature. We should have everything we need to proceed... SCCM (yes, I know, optional), Azure Premium, and Intune (another option from what I understand). I'm really looking forward to getting things rolling, but before I do, I'd love to hear from those who are actually using it on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some general questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do home-brewed applications work? What are your most common issues?&lt;br /&gt;Are users trying work arounds?&lt;br /&gt;If so, what kind and what have you done to curb this?&lt;br /&gt;How big are your organizations?&lt;br /&gt;Do you use the whole program, or do you use pieces?&lt;br /&gt;Any other tips or suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;How long have you been using it?&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I've read many an article with all great reviews, but since it's such a new product, I'd love to hear from you that actually use it and what you really think.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of adding a new larger RAID to our server.&amp;nbsp; Set-up is a Dell PE T610 running Server 2008 R2 on the physical machine hosting a 2012 R2 Essentials VM through HyperV.&amp;nbsp; Currently has a PERC H200 card and 4TB RAID10 that I'm replacing with am H710 card and 8TB RAID10.&amp;nbsp; Due to changing controller cards (and purposely not attempting the unsupported foreign config import from the H200 to H710), and wanting to be able to completely revert back to the old setup if things go sideways, my only option is to copy the VM to an external USB drive, disconnect the old RAID, connect the new RAID, copy the VM back to the new RAID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is, HOW to do this exactly.&amp;nbsp; And what is the most reliable and least complicated method.&amp;nbsp; I've been reading everything I can find, but there is precious little info on re-importing a VM to the exact same physical host.&amp;nbsp; I know simply copying the .vhd files to the new RAID and pointing the VM to them does not work.&amp;nbsp; The only other things I've been able to ascertain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&amp;nbsp; I can re-import the exact same VM to the new location, but FIRST I have to delete the old VM from HYPV manager.&amp;nbsp; I'm not comfortable doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&amp;nbsp; I can import the VM as a NEW VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm concerned about all of the issues that might crop up with having a new VM.&amp;nbsp; For instanc, I remember reading something about an issue with the virtual network card and MAC address.&amp;nbsp; Will I have to reconnect all of the client computers?&amp;nbsp; Will I have to re-set-up remote web access/remote client access?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm hoping there's away to accomplish option 1 without having to permanently delete the old VM.&amp;nbsp; I'm open to any suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we have a two node 2012 R2 Cluster. We are using Starwinds for shared storage. We have 10 VM roles, 1 dhcp server role and 3 Scale out file server Roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our goal is to provide maximum up time for the VM's and some important file shares.&amp;nbsp; The file share data is actually more important than the VM's. The shares are users, projects and operations.&amp;nbsp; Each share is 1.5 TB max with around 300GB used on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why, but when we originally designed this, Starwinds highly recommended that we create the file shares using the scale out file server role vs using the standard file server role or creating a "VM File server" to share the files.&amp;nbsp; So right now each of the shares is on a SOFS Role and shared to the users from there. From everything I've read this is NOT the way file server user shares should be setup. See&amp;nbsp;when to use a SOFS. The system currently works and fails over without issues but we're having issues to trying to backup the files. The VM's backup fine with no issues with just about any backup software. The problem is the file share data. Most backup software doesn't support MS clusters or doesn't work with SMB 3.0 or has some other little issue that makes it not work reliably or runs slower than I can deal with. Veeam file copy works but it's so slow. We're getting like 2MB/sec. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my question. What is the proper way to set this up to make backing up easy? Preferably with Veeam. We want to keep one or two copies onsite and one offsite. Spinning up the environment offsite would be great but is not mandatory, maybe something we can do in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because nearly all backup software is geared towards backing up VM's these days (not the files on the file share), my gut tells me to just create a VM and share the files from the VM. The problem with that is the VM's become huge (3x1.5 TB) and will take forever to migrate and restore. The current VM's are around 50GB and restore or migrate very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;I'm working on doing a server migration and running into some weird issues that I was hoping I could get some advice on.&amp;nbsp; Here is all the information in regards to the setup, old and new, and what has happened thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old server: Windows server 2012 essentials: Domain controller, file and printer server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Server: Vmware 6.5 running a vm of windows server 2012 r2 standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by moving files over. Once that transfer completed, I&amp;nbsp; began by adding the new server to the domain. It was added successfully. I then installed the roles on the new server and after a restart, followed the steps to promote the server to be an AD server. I then proceeded to transfer the 5 fsmo roles, and afterwards running netdom query fsmo showed all the roles assigned to the new server. In the past at this point I've been able to remove the server from the network, update dns, and proceed with the setup. However this is the point where I hit a wall. AD logins stopped responding once the old server was removed, and the new server was not indicating on the network card that it was linked to a domain network, even though the primary dns was pointed at itself. Everything appeared to be working properly from a settings perspective, but other pcs showed the echo %logonserver% as the old server, and attempting to RDP into the new server with domain credentials resulted in an error indicating it could not contact the domain controller. Reconnecting the old server resulted in things working properly again, so to me this seems to indicate the AD transfer didn't complete, even though all signs pointed to it completing. I had to transfer the fsmo roles back and then I attempted again later, still getting the same error. At this point I'm reformatting the new server install and starting over again, but wanted to get any advice on what issue I may be running into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We have a pc that is showing two menu items, for example Excel 2016. One works and one doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to remove the one that doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;At my company, we have folder redirection enabled for all users so their desktops, documents, etc are all stored on our file server. Additionally, our users with laptops and Surfaces (all Windows 8.1 or 10) have offline files enabled so their redirected folders are available when they're off-network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in the process of replacing our SAN and moving everything over to the new one. For reasons unknown to me, our old "file server" was not a Windows VM, but instead just a share running directly off the old SAN, meaning that just moving a VM or using DFS replication to copy all the data was not a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So over the weekend I used Robocopy to copy all the data off the old SAN share onto a new Windows 2012 R2 virtual machine. I verified everything copied over, verified all the permissions and ACLs were correct, etc. Then I switched the GPOs for folder redirection and our network share mappings to point to the new server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a precautionary measure, since the GPOs were pointed directly to the old SAN (\\san\shares\users\%username%; \\san\shares\departments\%something%; etc), we disabled the shares on the old SAN, so that clients that didn't update their paths correctly wouldn't be writing to a stale location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked fine for our desktop computers - except for a few minor hiccups, our desktops are all connecting to the new SAN, redirection and shares are working good, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our portable devices though are not cooperating quite as well. We've had a number of them still trying to connect to the old SAN, not getting the updated redirection/share paths, and just staying in a perpetual "offline" mode. To counter this, we tried removing the DNS record for the old SAN and replacing it with a CNAME pointing to the new file server, so that portable devices trying to connect to the old SAN would redirect to the new one and hopefully sync their files, but the Offline Files is still seeming to remain in an offline state, even though pinging the old SAN's name returns the correct IP of the new file server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 2 servers hosted on AWS. Both are running SQL Server Standard 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is on subnet A, 2nd one is on subnet B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet A is: 10.0.7.0/24 and i already assigned some IP including 10.0.7.225, 10.0.7.67&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnet B is: 10.0.9.0/24 with some IP assigned: 10.0.9.67, 10.0.9.133&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to create Availability Group but got this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the IP addresses configured for the availability group listener can be hosted by the server . Either configure a public cluster network on which one of the specified IP addresses can be hosted, or add another listener IP address which can be hosted on a public cluster network for this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IP i assigned is 10.0.9.100 (cause i replicated from A to B) so it can't conflict with any IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what i was missing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Long story short, we had a former employee setup our WDS. He didn't leave behind any SOPs and I've never set it up before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is, how do I take my custom VM from VMware and move it over to my WDS as a .wim file? I know that I have to run Sysprep somewhere in the process. Any help would be much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI, this is for Windows 10 v1709.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to deploy a package today that I've deployed lots of times before.&amp;nbsp; However, today I got an error that says "Conditions not met: No steps were able to run"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I checked the package and it doesn't have any conditions set on it.&amp;nbsp; The properties tab and the step tab are both clear of any conditions so I have no idea what it's referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else ever run into this before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there something out there, either AWS, Google, O365, Excel, or Office add-in (or other software?) that would allow me to do the following? This data is not in a database directly, but it is pulled together from over a dozen non-integrating sources into CSV format. Goal: to have&amp;nbsp;n&amp;nbsp;score card pdfs, or report cards whatever, using each row of data, filling in a score card, and emailing them to each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: taking SSRS and making a different distributed report for each row of data. It's easier to do with data-driven subscriptions in SSRS, but that is not available in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each row of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take each cell in row, fill out a template report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export report into PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email file according to email in one cell in that row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any ideas on how this can be accomplished? I'm stumped.&lt;/p&gt;
